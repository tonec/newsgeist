Wootson Jr. twitter TWEET More \nThe North Korean defector had sped across the demilitarised zone in a stolen Jeep, then crawled south as the men who had been his comrades moments ago shot at him with handguns and AK-47 rifles. \nSouth Korean soldiers found the defector under a pile of leaves, bleeding from at least five gunshot wounds. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link A South Korean army soldier, second from left, is seen as medical members treat an unidentified injured person, believed to be a North Korean soldier, at a hospital in Suwon, South Korea. Photo: AP \nHe was brought to doctors, who expected to find the soldier in bad shape. But what they also found when they opened him up gave the world a glimpse into just how bad things are in North Korea. \nDoctors repairing the unidentified soldier's digestive tract found dozens of parasites in his intestines. One of the suspected roundworms was nearly a foot long. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Lee Cook-jong describes the parasites found inside the body of a North Korean soldier at Ajou University Medical Centre in Suwon, South Korea. Photo: AP \n\"I spent more than 20 years of experience as a surgeon, but I have not found parasites this big in the intestines of South Koreans,\" Lee Cook-jong, who leads the team treating the soldier, told the Associated Press. \nAuthorities have not released the name or rank of the defecting soldier. He has spent his first days in South Korea unconscious, sedated and relying on a breathing machine to stay alive. Advertisement \nBut the worms taken from his intestines with tweezers tell a story of the humanitarian and health crisis gripping North Korea even as it expends significant resources in its effort to become a global nuclear power.   \nOther public spending priorities in North Korea have suffered, as leader Kim Jong Un has built and tested his nuclear arsenal while also trading radioactive barbs with Western leaders.

Shizuo Kambayashi/AP file photo Increase size \nMembers of the US military serving in all of Japan have been temporarily banned from drinking alcohol both on and off base following a fatal accident in Okinawa. \nA 61-year-old Japanese man in Okinawa was killed yesterday (Nov. 19) morning local time in Naha, Okinawa’s biggest city, after being hit by a vehicle driven by a US marine stationed on the island. Police said the blood alcohol content of the marine was three times Japan’s limit of 0.03%. US military personnel on Okinawa restricted to base, banned from alcohol after local man killed by truck driven by US serviceman pic.twitter.com/RKouyDUTiF — Alastair Gale (@AlastairGale) November 20, 2017 \nFollowing yesterday’s incident, Okinawa military servicepeople are also restricted from activities off base and must stay on base. \nThe incident is likely to further inflame already tense relations between the local population and the large US military presence in Okinawa, which despite its small size hosts the majority of American forces in Japan, about 50,000 servicepeople in total. The fatal accident also comes as Okinawans are protesting the planned relocation of the US Marine Corps base at Futenma—which is in the midst of a densely populated area—to off the coast of Henoko, a fishing village. Residents say that extensive construction will destroy the ecosystem of the area, including its coral reefs. \nOkinawans are also reeling from the crash of a US military Osprey helicopter near a school last month, though no one was hurt in the incident. US military helicopter crashes have happened from time to time in Okinawa, but fatalities involving local residents are infrequent (paywall). In 2004, a helicopter crashed onto a university campus in Okinawa, injuring its crew members. \nThe last major protests against the US military presence in Okinawa took place in mid-2016 after a serviceman was sentenced two-and-a-half years of hard labor for raping a Japanese woman that year, while another was charged for the murder and rape of another Okinawan woman. As a result, US troops faced similar restrictions , including a drinking ban, in what was called a “ period of unity and mourning .” The ban was lifted after less than a month. More from",

Image copyright AFP Image caption In 2016, tens of thousands of people joined protests against the US troops \nThe US presence on Okinawa in southern Japan is a key part of the security alliance between the two countries. The base houses about 26,000 US troops. \nThere are plans to relocate part of it to a less-populated area of the island, but many Okinawans want the air base removed altogether. \nThey object to the alleged crimes and accidents attributed to the troops . Resentment at the US presence has been growing among many locals, particularly since the 1995 gang-rape of a 12-year-old girl by US troops. \nIn 2016, the murder of a woman was linked to an ex-Marine employed at one of the bases, also leading to a temporary ban on alcohol as well as a midnight curfew .

Image copyright AFP Image caption In 2016, tens of thousands of people joined protests against the US troops \nThe US presence on Okinawa in southern Japan is a key part of the security alliance between the two countries. The base houses about 26,000 US troops. \nThere are plans to relocate part of it to a less-populated area of the island, but many Okinawans want the air base removed altogether. \nThey object to the alleged crimes and accidents attributed to the troops . Resentment at the US presence has been growing among many locals, particularly since the 1995 gang-rape of a 12-year-old girl by US troops. \nIn 2016, the murder of a woman was linked to an ex-Marine employed at one of the bases, also leading to a temporary ban on alcohol as well as a midnight curfew .

      "text": "Charles Manson , the pseudo-satanic sociopath behind a string of killings that shocked California out of its late 1960s cultural reverie, died on Sunday after almost a half century in prison.\nThe 83-year-old, who died of natural causes, had been serving multiple life sentences in state prison in Corcoran, California , for orchestrating the violence in 1969 that claimed the lives of Sharon Tate, the heavily pregnant wife of film director Roman Polanski, and six others.\nWhile his death prompted the inevitable and renewed questioning around why his grim notoriety had been so enduring, Michele Hanisee, president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, said: “Today, Manson’s victims are the ones who should be remembered and mourned on the occasion of his death.”\nShe went on to quote the late Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor who put Manson behind bars, who had said: “Manson was an evil, sophisticated conman with twisted and warped moral values.”\nQuick Guide A quick guide to Charles Manson Show Hide Who was Charles Manson? \nCharles Manson  was one of the most notorious murderers of the 20th century. He led a cult known as the Manson Family in California, most of whom were disaffected young women. Some became killers under his messianic influence.\nMurder from afar Despite spending more than  40 years in prison for the murders of seven people in 1969, Manson did not carry out the killings. Instead  he c onvinced  members of his ‘family’  to murder. One of their victims was the actor Sharon Tate, who was married to Roman Polanski and was more than eight months' pregnant when she was killed.\nCelebrity friends By the time of his trial in 1971, Manson had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for various crimes. He became a singer-songwriter before the Tate murders and got a break in the music industry when he met  Beach Boys' Dennis Wilson , who let him crash at his home.\nHelter Skelter It is believed that Manson intended using the murders to incite an apocalyptic race war he called Helter Skelter, taking the name from the Beatles song.\nNotorious by name The killings and the seven-month trial that followed were the subjects of fevered news coverage in the US. Manson occupied  a dark, persistent place in American culture , inspiring music, T-shirts and half the stage name of musician  Marilyn Manson .\nPhotograph: Los Angeles Times Was this helpful? \n\nThank you for your feedback. As the leader of a cult known as the Manson Family, Manson had instructed his followers, made up mostly of disaffected young women, to carry out the killings. The brutality of the murders set Los Angeles on edge, and ended the sunny optimism of the 60s counterculture and its aspirations to a new society built on peace and love. Manson presented himself as a demonic force: at trial, he carved a Nazi swastika into his forehead.\nThe five received the death penalty but were spared when capital punishment was temporarily abolished following a ruling by the supreme court in 1972.\nManson and three female followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were convicted of murder and conspiracy to murder . Another defendant, Charles “Tex” Watson, was convicted later.\nThe second summer of Charles Manson: why the cult murders still grip us Read more \nTate, the wife of Polanski, who was out of the country the night of her murder, was eight and a half months pregnant when Manson’s followers broke into her home in Los Angeles. They stabbed and shot Tate and her visitors, Jay Sebring, Voytek Frykowski, coffee heiress Abigail Folger and Steven Parent. The word “Pig” was written in blood on the front door. Tate, who had starred in The Valley of the Dolls, was stabbed 16 times, and an “X” was carved into her stomach.\nThe next night, his followers murdered couple Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.\nAlthough the followers committed the murders, Manson had ordered them. At the LaBianca home, he tied up the couple before leaving others to carry out the killings.\nAfter his death on Sunday night, Tate’s sister Debra told NBC : “One could say I’ve forgiven them, which is quite different than forgetting what they are capable of. It is for this reason I fight so hard to make sure that each of these individuals stays in prison until the end of their natural days.”\nIn the 2004 book Sharon Tate Recollection , Polanski wrote: “Even after so many years, I find myself unable to watch a spectacular sunset or visit a lovely old house or experience visual pleasure of any kind without instinctively telling myself how much she would have loved it all.”\nProsecutors at the time said Manson and his cult were trying to spark a race war that he believed was foretold in the Beatles song Helter Skelter, and hoped the Black Panthers would be blamed for the killings.\nBefore the murders, Manson spent most of his teens and 20s in and out of prison, and he later became a singer-songwriter. He got a break in the music industry when he met the Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson. The group later recorded Never Learn Not to Love, which Manson had written. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manson in a 2017 California department of corrections photo. Photograph: Reuters \nHe became friends with the Byrds producer Terry Melcher (the son of Doris Day) and even recorded 13 folksy songs for an album that eventually was titled Lie: The Love and Terror Cult; it was released in March 1970 to help pay for his defense.\nManson had established himself as a would-be cult leader in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. He took a handful of followers, some of whom would later be convicted in the killings, to the old Spahn Movie Ranch north of LA and turned it into a hedonistic commune.\nVan Houten, the youngest member of the original Manson Family, later said that Manson had used sex, LSD, Bible readings, repeated playing of the Beatles’ White Album and rambling lectures about triggering a revolution to brainwash her.\nVan Houten, 68, was convicted of the killings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. She was recommended for parole in September but California’s governor, Jerry Brown, has yet to approve the recommendation. He rejected an earlier decision, concluding that Van Houten posed “an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison”.\nIn June, officials denied a parole request by Krenwinkel, the state’s longest-serving female prisoner, after her attorney said she had been abused by Manson or another person. She has been denied parole multiple times in the past. \nManson’s lawyer, Irving Kanarek, claimed his client was innocent during a 2014 interview with the Guardian . “No question he was legally innocent. And, more than that, he was actually innocent,” Kanarek said, arguing that there was no evidence connecting him to the case.\nAt a 2012 parole hearing, which was denied, Manson was quoted as having said to one of his prison psychologists: “I’m special. I’m not like the average inmate. I have spent my life in prison. I have put five people in the grave. I am a very dangerous man.”\nCharles Manson – a life in pictures Read more \nAccording to the LA Times , Manson committed hundreds of rules violations while being held at the Corcoran state prison, including assault, repeated possession of a weapon and threatening staff. Officials said he has spat in guards’ faces, started fights, tried to cause a flood and set his mattress ablaze.\nIn 2014, Manson and Afton Elaine Burton, a 26-year-old Manson devotee, were granted a marriage license , but it expired before the two could marry. She had faithfully visited him in prison for seven years. Manson had been denied parole 12 times, with his next hearing set for 2027.\nHis death is unlikely to end interest in his crimes. Quentin Tarantino is believed to be preparing a film that uses the murders as a backdrop for its main plot, and an adaptation of Emma Cline’s bestselling 2016 novel, The Girls, is on the way.\n\nWriter Joan Didion interviewed Linda Kasabian, the Manson family member who acted as a lookout in the Tate and LaBianca killings and later gave evidence at the trial, and described the atmosphere in Hollywood in an essay from her collection The White Album (1979).\n“Everything was unmentionable but nothing was unimaginable…” Didion wrote. “A demented and seductive vortical tension was building in the community. The jitters were setting in. I recall a time when the dogs barked every night and the moon was always full.\n“I remember that no one was surprised.”\nReached at home in Manhattan, Didion, 82, told the Guardian: “Manson’s legacy was never obvious to me. It wasn’t obvious when I went to talk with Linda Kasabian, and it isn’t obvious to me now. But I do find it easy to put him from my mind.”\nIn 2008, California officials ordered the search of a deserted ranch in Death Valley where Manson and his family briefly resided. The search turned up no evidence of human remains.\nManson may be gone but the persistence of his dark vision endures. “I am crime,” he proclaimed in a telephone call to the New York Post from prison in the mid-2000s.",

      "text": "C an you think of anything worse, more horrendous or terrifying? It’s the middle of the night, you are fast asleep in bed, at home. Suddenly, you are woken by people bursting into the room. Burglars? No, worse, much worse: a film crew, and Michael bloody McIntyre.\nHe – McIntyre – has got questions to ask you; it’s a quiz. Name three fairground attractions. Who’s this? (A Teletubby walks into the room – the yellow one, Laa-Laa.) Make these bird noises, and this man (Bill Oddie walks in) will guess what they are …\nThis is what happens to Dean the plumber, set up by his wife Zoe, who is there in the bed, giggling guiltily. It’s called Midnight Game Show, a new element in Michael McIntyre’s Big Show (BBC1, Saturday), which is back for a third series.\nThe rest is familiar. At the start of the show, Michael bounds on to enthusiastic whooping and applause from the audience, and excitedly squawks out his standup routine. You know, family-friendly, safe, observational, have-you-noticed stuff, today about driving. Specifically windscreen wipers.\nWe Brits, he says, can adjust to different strengths of rain with our windscreen wipers like nobody else on earth. He demonstrates level-one-speed wipers, waving his arms about. Really Michael, yours come into each other like that? What do you drive, a coach? Then he turns up the speed (plus his own squawk volume), to level two, then level three …\nLevel THREE? Who has three wiper speeds, as well as intermittent (a whole new seam of comedy, as it happens)? If you are going to do observational, it needs to be recognisable, and true.\nOh, I see. McIntyre drives a £150,000 Ferrari , which probably does have level-three-speed wiping, for when he’s going really fast. And maybe wipers that come into each other. No wonder other comedians hate him . He’s made a load of money out of being bland and annoying.\nNext up, an old favourite, Celebrity Send To All. Ed Balls today, who first must get the entire audience up to do Gangnam Style, of course. Which is, undeniably, fun. As is the text that then goes out from the phone of the former shadow chancellor-turned-showbiz-tart, to all his contacts. “Just had a new hot tub delivered. Yvette’s at the party conference. So I’m having a party of my own. Anton Du Beke is here, Delia is doing canapes, and Stormzy’s coming (met him at Glasto, TOP guy). Grab your swimsuit and get down here … Gangnam Style. Best. Ed.”\nA good one, no? It’s that Stormzy mention, the Glasto reference, upper-case TOP, that make it. And, later, the replies start to come in, from Yvette, Peter Mandelson, Jeremy Vine and Judge Rinder, among others. My favourite reply is a non-celebrity one, from a councillor in Wakefield called Charlie K. “We’d love to, but just got back from Zakynthos, so me and Gracie are a bit travel weary … We’ll ring you in the week, take care, thanks for the invite.” No questioning of the genuineness of the invitation, just a polite no thanks, Charlie K is a bit tired – for a hot tub party with Stormzy and Delia.\nDamn you, McIntyre, I was hating you too, for being wrong about windscreen wipers, and for being bland and rich, squawky and boundy and annoyingly chipper (I like a bit of surreality in an act, and a comedian who doesn’t just hate themself, but also the world). But then he goes and does Celebrity Send To All with Ed Balls, and it’s really funny.\nAnd so it goes on. Emeli Sandé sings a song, I’ve already forgotten it. But then Stella, a cattery owner from Dorset, is Unexpected Star of the Show. She thinks her daughter has brought her to a cat cafe; she just has to go into this photo booth … Oops! The wall falls down, she is live on stage in front of 2,000 people (and Michael bloody McIntyre, of course). Will she sing for them, at the end of the show? Of course she will. She sings a Puccini aria, O Mio Babbino Caro, and it’s lovely, a little bit moving, even.\nIt’s all about the stunts, Michael McIntyre’s Big Show. They are not even especially original (everyone’s done a phone stunt, right?); they’re just done very well. And the best is the new one, Midnight Game Show. Breaking into someone’s house in the middle of the night for a celebrity quiz – that is original, and bold.\nDean the plumber, who sounds just like Frank Spencer, takes it remarkably well, scoring 100% in the quiz. I think he’s a fan of the comedian. Someone’s going to attack McIntyre, though, aren’t they? Well, it’s a rare opportunity to do so and get away with it.\nTopics Television Last night's TV Michael McIntyre reviews",

      "text": "MEXICO CITY— A former president of Mexico has a warning for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: Don’t abandon our country in NAFTA talks like some modern-day “Judas.”\nVicente Fox warns that would be a mistake.\nThe former Mexican president told CTV News that it wouldn’t do any good if Canada ditched Mexico in pursuit of a one-on-one trade deal with the U.S., in the misguided belief President Donald Trump would go easier on Canada.\nFox made his case using a biblical metaphor — urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau not to behave like the apostle who sold out Jesus Christ. \n“He might, like Judas, give us a strike and go with the United States and leave us aside,” Fox told the network, in an interview airing Sunday night.\n  “I warn Trudeau, and I warn Canada, you will not make it (better without Mexico).”\nThe Canadian government has repeatedly said it’s committed to working trilaterally to renew NAFTA as a three-country agreement. However, the Canadians have also raised eyebrows in Mexico by occasionally making more ambiguous comments: some Canadian officials have at times suggested they’re open to both bilateral or trilateral deals.\nTrump says he could do one or the other.\nIn a speech to Mexico’s Senate, the prime minister called for “progressive” values and the promotion of women’s rights in a possible new NAFTA treaty. Justin Trudeau wrapped up his first official trip to the country Friday. (The Canadian Press) Former prime minister Stephen Harper, in a memo earlier this year to associates obtained by The Canadian Press, appeared to favour the one-on-one approach. Harper suggested Trump had few trade complaints about Canada, and he said some Americans found it mystifying that the Canadian government remains so attached to a trilateral deal with Mexico.\nProponents of the three-country approach say it makes sense for several reasons: the continent has integrated supply chains for products like autos, some of the strongest defenders of trade in U.S. politics are from southern Mexican border states, and, they say, there’s no guarantee anyway that Trump would go soft in a separate negotiation with Canada.\nIn the CTV interview, Fox also did what he has done repeatedly over the last two years — blast Trump. Using a few four-letter profanities, the former Mexican president called Trump a destroyer, pitting America against the world.",

      "text": "Convicted mass murderer Charles Manson dies at 83 Published time: 20 Nov, 2017 06:02 Edited time: 21 Nov, 2017 07:13 Get short URL Charles Manson © California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Convicted mass murderer and former Manson family cult leader Charles Manson has died at the age of 83, officials confirmed. Manson \"died of natural causes.\" \n“Inmate Charles Manson, 83, died of natural causes at 8:13 p.m. on Sunday, November 19, 2017, at a Kern County hospital,” a statement from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says . \nA lifelong criminal and conman, Manson reinvented himself in the late 1960s, becoming a quasi-Christ-like figure among a group of hippies called the Manson Family. Manson convinced his followers to carry out his demonic plans, which resulted in the deaths of seven people, among them actress Sharon Tate, who was heavily pregnant at the time during the summer of 1969. Read more Charles Manson’s youngest disciple granted parole for 2nd time \nManson believed in what he called ‘Helter Skelter,’ a term he lifted from the Beatles song of the same name. Manson believed that ‘Helter Skelter’ meant the coming of an apocalyptic race war and believed that the murders he orchestrated would help bring about that war. \nDuring his trial, Manson insisted that he “killed no one” and denied he had ever ordered his followers to do so. Then-US President Richard Nixon said that Manson was “guilty, directly or indirectly.” \nIn 1971, Manson was convicted and sentenced to nine concurrent life sentences. Mason was originally sentenced to death, but managed to escape the death penalty after the 1972 decision in the case People v. Anderson led to “all capital sentences in California to be commuted life in prison.” \nHe spent 46 years in prison and was never granted parole. He was denied parole a total of 12 times, and his next hearing was set to take place no earlier than 2027. \nIn September, Manson’s youngest follower, Leslie Van Houten – who took part in the murder of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca – was granted parole. The decision can still be reversed, as California Governor Jerry Brown has about two month left to affirm or deny it. Van Houten had been denied parole 20 times, and it was Governor Brown who secured her further stay in prison last year. \nIn the 1980s, he gave four notable interviews, during which he sported his now trademark Swastika symbol in the middle of his forehead, where he had carved an ‘X’ during his trial. The third interview with Geraldo Rivera focused on Satanism. \nREAD MORE: Charles Manson follower Patricia Krenwinkel denied parole in California \nThis is arguably what Manson wanted all along – he was finally being interviewed on national television, having been dismissed as crazy and marginalized by the music scene in the 1960s. Reporter Linda Deutsch, who covered Manson’s trial, said what he really wanted to do was become famous. \n“So he wanted to make a statement (with the murders) and be the star that Hollywood wouldn’t let him be,” she said. “And he was demonic.”",

We learnt so much from Narayan - and admired how he created a compassionate environment at NDTV and, in fact, everywhere he went, with everyone he met. Just as we loved him, there are hundreds of others like us for whom Narayan was very, very special. Seldom has a person been loved by so many and will be deeply missed by so many.Narayan was one of a kind. A towering personality in every way.This morning, he passed away at 8:00 am after a two-year fight against cancer. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family - his wife, Renu, and his sons, Jayant, Arjun - and with so many other close friends around him.His unshakeable integrity and his ability to make time to address the concerns of every person at NDTV, no matter how senior or junior, was what we counted on day after day as an institution - among many other qualities that he brought to work day after day as the CEO.He leaves a gigantic vacuum in our lives. We are forever grateful for his selfless leadership at NDTV and for his friendship, kindness and decency as a human being to all of us.We will miss you Narayan. More than you can imagine. Everyone at NDTV will miss you. More than you can imagine.God bless you Narayan.",

      "text": "(Before It's News) Rumor Mill News Agents Forum Reports: US Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Lands at Langley! 2200 Marines! US Marines Storm the CIA Headquarters in Langley Posted By: Mr.Ed [ Send E-Mail ]\nDate: Sunday, 19-Nov-2017 12:35:10\nReports: US Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Lands at Langley! 2200 Marines! US Marines Storm the CIA Headquarters in Langley\nFILE PHOTO: Tilt-Rotor Aircraft\nReports are beginning to surface that a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) landed at Langley on Saturday.\nA Marine expeditionary unit (MEU, pronounced “Mew”), is the smallest Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) in the United States Fleet Marine Force. Each MEU is an expeditionary quick reaction force, deployed and ready for immediate response to any crisis, whether it be natural disaster or combat missions.\nA Marine expeditionary unit is normally composed of: a reinforced Marine infantry battalion (designated as a Battalion Landing Team) as the ground combat element, a composite medium tiltrotor squadron forms the aviation combat element, a combat logistics battalion provides the logistics combat element, and a company-size command element serves as the MEU headquarters group.\nTroop strength is about 2,200 and usually commanded by a colonel, and is deployed from amphibious assault ships. Currently, a Marine expeditionary unit embarks Marines and equipment onto the amphibious warfare ships of an Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) which also includes escort ships and submarines to protect them from air, surface, and submarine threats. For further protection and strong air support, such an ESG is often deployed along with one or more carrier battle groups.\nWITNESSES\nAccording to persons who reside near Langley, a large contingent of Marines arrived at CIA Headquarters in tilt-rotor aircraft and when the Marines deplaned, they were armed and moved quickly into CIA Headquarters!\nThose witnesses also say that a significant number of tilt-rotor aircraft can be clearly seen on the grounds of CIA Headquarters, parked on the grass around the building.\nThis is not normal.\nNever before has anything like this ever been seen taking place at CIA Headquarters and speculation is now running rampant as to what is actually taking place.\nConspiracy Theorists are claiming the President of the United States is moving to take out rogue elements in the Intelligence Community, at the request of his new CIA Director. It is rumored that these rogue elements have been undermining the Administration since before it took office last January, and may be connected to some well publicized “incidents” which suddenly resumed taking place this year, (mass shootings / violent protests) after a brief respite once the Obama Administration left office.\nMoreover, there is not one word of Marines landing at Langley, appearing in _any_ US mass-media outlet.\nUPDATE 5:51 AM EST –\nThe number of SEALED INDICTMENTS presently on US District Court Dockets across the United States has reached an astonishing 1800 as of Friday, November 17. These Sealed Indictments began appearing on US District Court Dockets on October 31.\nThere have never been this many Sealed Indictments showing on federal court Dockets at the same time . . . ever.\nThe existence of so many sealed Indictments has lead others to suggest that large groups of federal officials – perhaps including elected officials – are facing mass arrest over a number of corruption-related activities such as “pay-to-play” the UraniumOne conspiracy, Pedophile Rings and other criminal activities, and these troops may be needed to keep order once the high officials start being taken under arrest!\nThis is especially interesting given revelations late last week, that an FBI Informant allegedly has VIDEO of Clinton Foundation people being given suitcases full of cash from Russians, prior to the approval of the UraniumOne deal which sold twenty percent of US Uranium manufacturing to Russia’s state-owned ROSATOM corporation.\nThe existence of video showing cash payoffs has sent a slew of people from the former Administration into fits of anxiety that their schemes are uncovered and many of them are going to prison for what they did. Desperate people can sometimes do desperate things and if those people are high-ranking federal officials, God only knows what they might have in the works to try to save themselves.\nThis is a developing story. Updates will be made as information becomes available.\nSource: Hal Turner Radio Show\nReports: US Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Lands at Langley! 2200 Marines!\nhttp://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/news/u-s-national-news/1626-reports-us-marine-expeditionary-unit-meu-lands-at-langley-2200-marines\nNESARA- Restore America – Galactic News\nSource: http://nesaranews.blogspot.com/2017/11/reports-us-marine-expeditionary-unit.html",

      "text": "http://str.sg/4vRP Copy \nNEW YORK (NYTIMES) - Charles Manson, one of the most notorious murderers of the 20th century, who was very likely the most culturally persistent and perhaps also the most inscrutable, died on Sunday (Nov 19) in Kern County, California. \nHe was 83 and had been behind bars for most of his life. He died of natural causes in a hospital, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a news release. \nManson was a semi-literate habitual criminal and failed musician before he came to irrevocable attention in the late 1960s as the wild-eyed leader of the Manson family, a murderous band of young drifters in California. \nConvicted of nine murders in all, Manson was known in particular for the seven brutal killings collectively called the Tate-LaBianca murders, committed by his followers on two consecutive August nights in 1969. \nThe most famous of the victims was Sharon Tate, an actress who was married to the film director Roman Polanski. Eight and a half months pregnant, she was killed with four other people at her Benedict Canyon home. \nThe Tate-LaBianca killings and the seven-month trial that followed were the subjects of fevered news coverage. To a frightened, mesmerised public, the murders, with their undercurrents of sex, drugs, rock ‘n’ roll and Satanism, seemed the depraved logical extension of the anti-establishment, do-your-own-thing ethos that helped define the '60s. \nSince then, the Manson family has occupied a dark, persistent place in American culture – and American commerce. It has inspired, among other things, pop songs, an opera, films, a host of internet fan sites, T-shirts, children’s wear and half the stage name of the rock musician Marilyn Manson. \nIt has also been the subject of many non-fiction books, most famously Helter Skelter (1974), by Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry. \nBugliosi was the lead prosecutor at the Tate-LaBianca trial. The Manson family came to renewed attention in 2008, when officials in California, responding to long speculation that there were victims still unaccounted for, searched a stretch of desert in Death Valley. There, in a derelict place known as the Barker Ranch, Manson and his followers had lived for a time in the late ‘60s. The search turned up no human remains. \nIt was a measure of Manson’s hold over his followers, mostly young women who had fled middle-class homes, that he was not physically present at the precise moment that any of the Tate-LaBianca victims was killed. Yet his family swiftly murdered them on his orders, which, according to many later accounts, were meant to incite an apocalyptic race war that Manson called Helter Skelter. \nHe took the name from the title of a Beatles song. Throughout the decades since, Manson has remained an enigma. \nWas he a paranoid schizophrenic, as some observers have suggested? Was he a sociopath, devoid of human feeling? Was he a charismatic guru, as his followers once believed and his fans seemingly still do? Or was he simply flotsam, a man whose life, The New York Times wrote in 1970, “stands as a monument to parental neglect and the failure of the public correctional system”? \nNo Name Maddox, as Manson was officially first known, was born on Nov 12, 1934, to a 16-year-old unwed mother in Cincinnati. (Many accounts give the date erroneously as Nov 11.) \nHis mother, Kathleen Maddox, was often described as having been a prostitute. What is certain, according to Bugliosi’s book and other accounts, is that she was a heavy drinker who lived on the margins of society with a series of men. \nManson apparently never knew his biological father. His mother briefly married another man, William Manson, and gave her young son the name Charles Milles Manson. \nKathleen often disappeared for long periods – when Charles was 5, for instance, she was sent to prison for robbing a gas station – leaving him to bounce among relatives in Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky. She was paroled when Charles was 8 and took him back, but kept him for only a few years. \nFrom the age of 12 on, Charles was placed in a string of reform schools. \nAt one institution, he held a razor to a boy’s throat and raped him. Escaping often, he committed burglaries, auto thefts and armed robberies, landing in between in juvenile detention centres and eventually federal reformatories. He was paroled from the last one at 19, in May 1954. \nStarting in the mid-1950s, Manson, living mostly in Southern California, was variously a busboy, parking-lot attendant, car thief, check forger and pimp. \nDuring this period, he was in and out of prison. He was married twice: in 1955 to Rosalie Jean Willis, a teenage waitress, and a few years later to a young prostitute named Leona. Both marriages ended in divorce. \nManson was believed to have fathered at least two children over the years: at least one with one of his wives, and at least one more with one of his followers. The precise number, names and whereabouts of his children – a subject around which rumour and urban legend have long coalesced – could not be confirmed. \nBy March 1967, when Manson, then 32, was paroled from his latest prison stay, he had spent more than half his life in correctional facilities. On his release, he moved to the Bay Area and eventually settled in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, the nerve centre of hippiedom, just in time for the Summer of Love. \nThere, espousing a philosophy that was an idiosyncratic mix of Scientology, hippie anti-authoritarianism, Beatles lyrics, the Book of Revelation and the writings of Hitler, he began to draw into his orbit the rootless young adherents who would become known as the Manson family. \nManson had learned to play the guitar in prison and hoped to make it as a singer-songwriter. His voice was once compared to that of the young Frankie Laine, a crooner who first came to prominence in the 1930s. \nManson’s lyrics, by contrast, were often about sex and death, but in the '60s, that did not stand out very much. (Songs he wrote were later recorded by Guns N’ Roses). \nOnce he was famous, Manson himself released several albums, including LIE, issued in 1970, and Live At San Quentin\", issued in 2006. \nWith his followers – a loose, shifting band of a dozen or more – Manson left San Francisco for Los Angeles. They stayed awhile in the home of Dennis Wilson, the Beach Boys’ drummer. \nManson hoped the association would help him land a recording contract, but none materialised. (The Beach Boys did later record a song, Never Learn Not To Love, that was based on one written by Manson, although Wilson, who sang it, gave it new lyrics and a new title – Manson had called it Cease To Exist – and took credit for writing it.) \nThe Manson family next moved to the Spahn Movie Ranch, a mock Old West town north of Los Angeles that was once a film set but had since fallen to ruins. \nThe group later moved to Death Valley, eventually settling at the Barker Ranch. \nThe desert location would protect the family, Manson apparently thought, in the clash of the races that he believed was inevitable. He openly professed his hatred of black people, and he believed that when Helter Skelter came, blacks would annihilate whites. Then, unable to govern themselves, the blacks would turn for leadership to the Manson family, who would have ridden out the conflict in deep underground holes in the desert. \nAt some point, Manson seems to have decided to help Helter Skelter along. Late at night on Aug 8, 1969, he dispatched four family members – Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Charles Watson and Linda Kasabian – to the Tate home in the Hollywood hills. \nManson knew the house: Terry Melcher, a well-known record producer with whom he had dealt fruitlessly, had once lived there. \nShortly after midnight on Aug 9, 1969, Atkins, Krenwinkel and Watson entered the house while Kasabian waited outside. Through a frenzied combination of shooting, stabbing, beating and hanging, they murdered Tate and four others in the house and on the grounds: Jay Sebring, a Hollywood hairdresser; Abigail Folger, an heiress to the Folger coffee fortune; Voytek (also spelled Wojciech) Frykowski, Folger’s boyfriend; and Steven Parent, an 18-year-old visitor. Tate’s husband, Polanski, was in London at the time. Before leaving, Atkins scrawled the word “pig” in blood on the front door of the house; in Manson’s peculiar logic, the killings were supposed to look like the work of black militants. \nThe next night, Aug 10, 1969, Manson and a half-dozen followers drove to a Los Angeles house he appeared to have selected at random. \nInside, Manson tied up the residents – a wealthy grocer named Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary – before leaving. \nAfter he was gone, several family members stabbed the couple to death. The phrases “Death to Pigs” and “Healter Skelter”, misspelled, were scrawled in blood at the scene. \nThe seven murders went unsolved for months. Then, in the autumn of 1969, the police closed in on the Manson family after Atkins, in jail on an unrelated murder charge, bragged to cellmates about the killings. \nOn June 15, 1970, Manson, Atkins, Krenwinkel and a fourth family member, Leslie Van Houten, went on trial for murder. Kasabian, who had been present on both nights but said she had not participated in the killings, became the prosecution’s star witness and was given immunity. \nWatson, who had fled to Texas, was tried and convicted separately. During the trial, the bizarre became routine. On one occasion, Manson lunged at the judge with a pencil. On another, he punched his lawyer in open court. At one point, Manson appeared in court with an “X” carved into his forehead; his co-defendants quickly followed suit. (Manson later carved the X into a swastika, which remained flagrantly visible ever after.) \nOutside the courthouse, a small flock of chanting family members kept vigil. One of them, Lynette Fromme, nicknamed Squeaky, would make headlines herself in 1975 when she tried to assassinate President Gerald Ford. \nOn Jan. 25, 1971, after nine days’ deliberation, the jury found Manson, Atkins and Krenwinkel guilty of seven counts of murder each. Van Houten, who had been present only at the LaBianca murders, was found guilty of two counts. All four were also convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. \nOn March 29, the jury voted to give all four defendants the death penalty. In 1972, after capital punishment was temporarily outlawed in California, their sentences were reduced to life in prison. \nManson was convicted separately of two other murders: those of Gary Hinman, a musician killed by Manson family members in late July 1969, and Donald Shea, a Barker Ranch stuntman killed late that August. \nAltogether, Manson and seven family members were eventually convicted of one to nine murders apiece. Incarcerated in a series of prisons over the years, Manson passed the time by playing the guitar, doing menial chores and making scorpions and spiders out of thread from his socks. \nHis notoriety made him a target: In 1984, he was treated for second- and third-degree burns after being doused with paint thinner by a fellow inmate and set ablaze. \nManson was turned down for parole a dozen times, most recently in 2012. Most of the other convicted family members remain in prison. \nAtkins died in prison in 2009, at 61, of natural causes. \nThe Manson family was an inspiration for the television series Aquarius, broadcast on NBC in 2015 and 2016. A period drama set in the late '60s, it starred David Duchovny as a Los Angeles police detective who comes up against Manson (played by the British actor Gethin Anthony) in the course of investigating a teenage girl’s disappearance. \nTo the end of his life, Manson denied having ordered the Tate-LaBianca murders. Nor, as he replied to a question he was often asked, did he feel remorse, in any case. \nHe said as much in 1986 in a prison interview with the television journalist Charlie Rose. \n“So you didn’t care?” Rose asked, invoking Tate and her unborn child. \n“Care?” Manson replied. \nHe added, “What the hell does that mean, ‘care’?” Topics: ",

Jetzt ist Manson im Alter von 83 Jahren gestorben. Charles Manson im August 2017. Nun ist der Massenmörder im Gefängnis gestorben. Foto: AFP Photo/California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \nDer frühere Sektenführer und verurteilte Mehrfachmörder Charles Manson ist tot. Manson starb am Sonntagabend (Ortszeit) im Alter von 83 Jahren in einem Krankenhaus in Kern County (Kalifornien) eines natürlichen Todes, wie die kalifornische Gefängnisbehörde mitteilte. Der Kriminelle mit eingeritztem Hakenkreuz auf der Stirn war zu lebenslanger Haft verurteilt gewesen . Vor einigen Tagen war Manson ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert worden, nachdem sich sein Gesundheitszustand verschlechtert hatte. Nähere Details nannten die Gefängnisbehörden zunächst nicht. \nManson hatte im August 1969 eine Handvoll seiner Anhänger zu einer brutalen Mordserie in Los Angeles angestiftet. Zu den Opfern zählte die hochschwangere Schauspielerin Sharon Tate , Ehefrau von Regisseur Roman Polanski. Mit ihr wurden vier Gäste in ihrer Villa bei Los Angeles brutal ermordet. In der folgenden Nacht wüteten die Mörder im Haus der Geschäftsleute Leno und Rosemary LaBianca. Manson erhielt im Frühjahr 1971 die Todesstrafe \nManson war nicht selbst am Tatort, wurde aber nach einem langen, spektakulären Mordprozess als Drahtzieher der Verbrechen verurteilt. Im Frühjahr 1971 erhielten Manson und seine engsten Anhänger die Todesstrafe. Das Strafmaß wurde später - nach Aussetzung der Todesstrafe in Kalifornien - in lebenslange Haft umgewandelt. Manson saß zuletzt im Staatsgefängnis von Kalifornien in Corcoran ein. Eine Freilassung auf Bewährung wurde ihm bereits ein Dutzend Mal verwehrt, wie die „Los Angeles Times“ schrieb. Die nächste Bewährungsanhörung war für das Jahr 2027 angesetzt. \nDie Polizeifotos nach Mansons Festnahme zeigten einen Mann mit einem durchdringenden Blick und wirren, dunklen Locken, der sich später ein Hakenkreuz auf die Stirn tätowieren ließ. \nManson war ein Kleinkrimineller mit einem langen Vorstrafenregister, als er 1967 in San Franciscos Hippie-Szene als charismatischer Kommunenanführer Anhänger um sich scharte. Die „Manson Family“ ließ sich dann in Südkalifornien nieder. \nWeibliche Mitglieder, wie seine Mitangeklagten Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel und Leslie Van Houten, hielten während des Prozesses loyal zu Manson, den sie als „Jesus Christus“ verehrten. Erst später gingen sie auf Distanz und bedauerten ihre Taten. Atkins starb 2009 im Alter von 61 Jahren im Gefängnis an Krebs. ( dpa )",

      "text": "US 1960s cult killer Charles Manson dies at 83   11:50 Manson headed an apocalyptic cult in the 1960s \nCharles Manson, the cult leader who masterminded a savage killing spree in the United States in the late 1960s that shocked the world, has died aged 83, California prison officials said. \nManson died of natural causes at 8.13pm yesterday (2.13am Irish time) at a hospital in Kern County, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a brief statement. \nDebra Tate - the sister of Manson's most famous victim, Sharon Tate - told celebrity website TMZ that she received a call from prison officials notifying her of Manson's death. \nManson was earlier moved from the Corcoran State Prison to a hospital in the city of Bakersfield, in Kern County, to be treated for an unspecified illness, US media reported. \nIn the late 1960s, Manson headed an apocalyptic cult that committed random murders in upscale mostly white neighbourhoods of Los Angeles - unleashing a wave of panic in the city and beyond. \nThe aim was for African Americans to be blamed, in the hope of sparking what he believed to be an impending and apocalyptic race war. \nHis \"Family\" disciples committed at least nine murders, but it was the horrific killing spree of seven people on 9-10 August 1969 that sealed his notoriety - and earned him life in prison. \nThe most famous victim was 26-year-old actress Sharon Tate, the heavily-pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski, who pleaded for the life of her unborn child before she was stabbed to death. Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate on their wedding day \nManson was not present, but ordered the killings. \nThe horrifying episode was followed by a double-murder the following night of a supermarket executive and his wife; the two-day spree became known as the Tate/LaBianca killings. \nOther celebrities including Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor and Steve McQueen were reportedly targets for The Family. \nManson, who has never shown remorse, was sentenced to death in 1971 along with four of his disciples for having led the killings of seven people. \nThe sentences were later commuted to life in prison when California abolished the death penalty. — RTÉ News (@rtenews) November 20, 2017 \nDuring his marathon trial, Manson - with a beard, long unwashed hair, and a swastika tattooed on his forehead - was portrayed as a drug-crazed loner with mesmerising powers of persuasion. \nUpon his death, he had been in prison in California since 1971, during which he applied for parole 12 times, telling the court on the last occasion in 2012 that he was \"a very dangerous man.\" \nIn each case, he was denied release and was not eligible to apply again until 2027. \nIn a 1981 interview conducted from jail, Manson said he had already spent most of his life in prison and felt at home there. \nDuring the so-called \"Summer of Love,\" in San Francisco, Manson took up busking with his guitar, but soon established himself at the centre of a drug-fuelled commune, surrounded by mostly female followers he called his \"Family.\" \nAt the outset a nomadic community, it later set up base in a ranch in California's Death Valley. The \"Family\" lived on the fringes of society and Manson had at least one child with one of his followers. \nManson became obsessed with the Beatles, and embraced a twisted philosophy inspired by lyrics of the legendary group. \nDescribing himself as a reincarnation of Jesus Christ, Manson arranged a series of murders in a bid to trigger a race war he dubbed \"Helter Skelter,\" a term taken from the Beatles song of the same name. \nIn prison, he was granted permission in 2014 to wed then 26-year-old Afton Elaine Burton who had been visiting him. But the 90-day license expired without the ceremony going ahead. \nDebra Tate said she was still processing the news of his death, but added she had \"said a prayer for Manson's soul and has forgiven the family but refuses to forget what they did\". \nAnthony DiMaria, the nephew of Manson victim Jay Sebring, said his death brought \"no joy or comfort\". \nHe told US magazine People: \"For years our family's involvement in the parole hearings has had nothing to do with anger or hatred towards the inmates. We go out of love to speak for those who can't speak for themselves. For justice. \n\"So today we derive no joy or comfort from the passing of Mr Manson. Nor is there closure because nothing will bring back Jay, or any of the victims sent to their graves 48 years ago. For us, our hearts and thoughts are with them.\" \nMichele Hanisee, president of Los Angeles' Association of Deputy District Attorneys, said: \"Today, Manson's victims are the ones who should be remembered and mourned on the occasion of his death.\" \nBut she also highlighted the words of the late Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Manson and described him as \"an evil, sophisticated con man with twisted and warped moral values\".

      "text": "566 Postings Manson war einer der berühmtesten Verbrecher Amerikas. Die Morde seiner \"Family\" beendeten Ende der 1960er den Hippietraum, die Popkultur machte aus ihm eine Ikone des Bösen \nWien – Wenn Verbrecher sterben, erscheinen Nachrufe auf sie selten im Kulturteil. Im Fall von Charles Manson schon. Denn die Taten des US-Amerikaners schlugen sich massiv kulturell nieder, er wurde zu einer Ikone des Bösen, zu einem Synonym für \"Bad America\". Die Verbrechen seiner \"Family\" genannten Bande raubten der Hippiebewegung die Unschuld. \nIm Sommer 1969 beging sie auf Mansons Geheiß neun Morde in und um Los Angeles. Eines der Opfer war die schwangere Schauspielerin Sharon Tate, die Frau des Regisseurs Roman Polanski. Im Herbst kam die Polizei Manson und seinen Komplizen auf die Spur, 1970 wurde der oft als Massenmörder titulierte Manson wegen Verschwörung zum mehrfachen Mord zum Tod verurteilt. Er selbst hat niemanden ermordet, das ließ er andere für sich erledigen. \n1972 hob Kalifornien die Todesstrafe als verfassungswidrig auf, Todesurteile wurden in lebenslange Haft umgewandelt. Zuletzt saß Manson im California State Prison Corcoran. Nun ist er 83-jährig gestorben. \nGeboren wurde Charles Milles Manson am 12. November 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Seine Mutter, damals 16 Jahre alt, saß wegen bewaffneten Raubüberfalls im Gefängnis. Manson wuchs bei Verwandten auf und landete noch als Jugendlicher in sogenannten Besserungsanstalten. Nach einer siebenjährigen Haftstrafe wurde er 1967 entlassen. Er ging nach San Francisco und fand sich inmitten der Hippiekultur wieder. Der kleine Mann mit dem stechenden Blick umgab sich mit jungen Ausreißern und gründete die sektenhafte \"Manson Family\". Paranoiawelt \"Helter Skelter\" \nAls ihr manipulativer Anführer fantasierte er sich eine Welt an einer Zeitenwende zusammen, die er nach dem Beatles-Song \"Helter Skelter\" nannte. Er wollte Rassenunruhen provozieren, um die Verfolgung von Schwarzen zu legitimieren. Seine Theorie war ein Mix aus Paranoia, Nazirassismus, Drogen und sexueller Freizügigkeit. Zudem hatte Manson musikalische Ambitionen. \nIm Gefängnis hatte er Gitarrespielen gelernt, mochte die Beatles und fand in Dennis Wilson, dem Schlagzeuger der Beach Boys, einen kurzfristigen Förderer und Unterstützer. Wilson ließ Manson und sein Gefolge bei sich wohnen, die Beach Boys nahmen einen seiner Songs auf. Neil Young und andere Westküstenmusiker kreuzten seinen Weg. Das berühmte \"Life\"-Cover \nNach seiner Festnahme hob ihn das \"Life\"-Magazin aufs Cover: Das Titelbild mit dem Typ mit dem irrem Blick ging um die Welt. Mehrmals wurde die Geschichte der Manson Family verfilmt, 1971 erschien Ed Sanders' Buch \"The Family\", eines von vielen, die sich dem Sujet widmeten. Punk und Postpunk kokettierten mit Manson. Bands und Musiker wie Psychic TV, Ozzy Osbourne, GG Allin, Sonic Youth und Guns N' Roses coverten seine Songs. Trent Reznor von Nine Inch Nails bewohnte Polanskis ehemalige Villa während der 1990er, die Band Kasabian ist nach einem \"Family\"-Mitglied benannt. \nVon Manson selbst gibt es rund 50 Alben und Singles. Es sind Machwerke, die sich über die Magie des Bösen verkaufen. Brian Warners Künstlername Marilyn Manson ist eine Mischung aus Marilyn Monroe und Charles Manson, ein Ying und Yang des amerikanischen Traums und Albtraums. \nIm Gefängnis gab Manson einige berüchtigte TV-Interviews. Sie zeigen einen wirr gestikulierenden Mann in Gefängnisuniform mit einer Hakenkreuztätowierung auf der Stirn. 1984 überlebte er nur knapp einen Brandanschlag, seine Gnadengesuche wurden alle abgelehnt. 2014 erhielt er die Genehmigung, die 26-jährige Afton Elaine Burton zu heiraten, doch er ließ den Termin verstreichen. Angeblich wollte sie ihn nach seinem Tod konserviert ausstellen. \nNun hat das Gruseln ein Ende gefunden. Am Montag ist Charles Manson nach langer Krankheit gestorben. Er wurde 83 Jahre alt, fast 60 davon verbrachte er im Gefängnis. (Karl Fluch, 20.11.2017) foto: ap",

      "text": "Australian cricketer Tom Moody THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Australian cricketer Tom Moody had to finally clarify on the social media, with an emoji of a face with tears of joy, that he has nothing to do with international rating agency Moody's Investors Service. All thanks to the pro-CPM and pro-RSS cyber warriors of Kerala. The clarification comes amidst charges raised by the pro-CPM profiles that their saffron counterparts have been faking their profiles to criticise Mr Moody for giving India an upgrade. And they have a point, too: they faced much embarrassment after the cricketer was barraged with criticisms and abuses from profiles of pro-CPM activists who, it was made out, mistook him as the man behind Moody's, the rating agency.\nThe pro-Modi camp lost no time pinning the comrades down, saying they could never differentiate between the two Moodys. As the troll war continued and hit the headlines, Mr Moody came out with the clarification in a humorous tone. \"Thanks to all of you who had realise I don't work in the finance rating industry,\" he tweeted. The pro-CPM profiles put up a late resistance pointing out that the timelines of many profiles which sent abusive messages to the cricketer had earlier shared propaganda material of the Sangh parivar.\n\"The criticisms against Mr Moody were first reported by the pro-RSS media,\" said Shankar Das, a pro-CPM profile. \"A social media activist, Advaid, had on his Twitter page exposed the fake profiles that had sent out those abusive comments, forcing many to withdrew their reports.\" He said the saffron side lost its grip on the cyber space after it started attacking Kerala for no reason. \"Earlier it was easy for them to mislead people by posting edited pictures and claiming that they were of Gujarat,\" Mr Das said. \"It works no more.\"",

      "text": "Last Published: Mon, Nov 20 2017. 06 58 PM IST Biocon shares rise 7% after Bengaluru unit gets US FDA clearance Biocon’s Bengaluru unit, which had received observations relating to lapses in quality compliance earlier this year, has been cleared by the US FDA Isha Trivedi Shares of Biocon closed 7.27% up at Rs423 on the BSE, while benchmark Sensex index closed 0.05% higher at 33,359.90 points. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint \nMumbai: Biocon Ltd’s shares jumped over 7% after the company said on Monday that its manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, which had received observations relating to lapses in quality compliance earlier this year, has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n“The US FDA has issued an Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) in relation to the cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) inspection of its aseptic drug product facility that was audited between 25 May and 3 June 2017. The FDA has classified the outcome of this inspection as VAI (voluntary action indicated) and the EIR states that the inspection is closed,” the company said in a stock exchange filing on Monday. \nThis development is positive for the company as it has filed applications for key biosimilars such as trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim with the US regulator from this manufacturing facility. Final marketing approval for these drugs can be held back if the facility is not cleared. \nShares of Biocon closed 7.27% up at Rs423 on the BSE, while benchmark Sensex index closed 0.05% higher at 33,359.90 points. \nFollowing the inspection that ended on 3 June, the US FDA had issued Form 483 to the facility with 10 observations of violations of GMP norms. \nThe FDA issues a Form 483 to a company’s manufacturing unit if its investigators spot any condition that in their judgement may constitute a violation of the US Food Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and related acts. \n“The receipt of EIR means Biocon can get product approvals filed from the unit. This is a positive development as it paves way for the company’s biosimilars to take off in the US. Now we have to watch out for next action from European regulator, which will be a big trigger for the stock,” Afzaal Mohammed, manager – fundamental research, Karvy Stock Broking, said. \nIn March, Biocon’s drug substance and drug product sites in Bengaluru were inspected by French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety on behalf of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). \nWhile the French regulator issued GMP certificates to the company’s two drug substance manufacturing units, it found quality lapses in the drug product unit. \nOn 7 November, Biocon said its partner Mylan NV has resubmitted marketing authorisation applications for biosimilars trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim with EMA that were withdrawn in August due to quality compliance issues observed by the French regulator at Biocon’s plant. \nThe company will get GMP compliance certificate for the drug product facility only after a follow-up inspection by EMA to verify the implementation of the corrective and preventive actions for the plant. Until the facility is cleared, Biocon will not get marketing approval for its biosimilars in Europe.   12 17 PM IST",

      "text": "Convicted mass murderer Charles Manson is shown in this handout picture from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation dated June 16, 2011. Reuters Charles Manson, the wild-eyed cult leader who orchestrated a string of gruesome killings in Southern California by his \"family\" of young followers, shattering the peace-and-love ethos of the late 1960s, died on Sunday, prison officials said. He was 83.\nManson died of natural causes Sunday evening at a Kern County hospital, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. It gave no further details of the circumstances surrounding his death.\nHe had been serving a life sentence at the nearby Corcoran State Prison for ordering the murders of nine people, including actress Sharon Tate.\nLong after Manson had largely faded from headlines, he loomed large as a symbol of the terror he unleashed in the summer of 1969.\n\"The very name Manson has become a metaphor for evil,\" the late Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Manson, told the Los Angeles Times in 1994.\nA recent photograph showed the gray-bearded killer's face still bearing the scar of a swastika he carved into his forehead decades earlier.\nManson became one of the 20th century's most notorious criminals when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war.\nGRAFFITI WITH VICTIMS' BLOOD\nTate, aged 26 and eight months pregnant, was stabbed 16 times in the early morning hours of Aug. 9, 1969, by members of Manson's cult at the rented hillside house she shared with her husband, filmmaker Roman Polanski, in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles.\nFour friends of the celebrity couple, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring, were also stabbed or shot to death that night by Manson followers, who scrawled the word \"Pig\" in blood on the home's front door before leaving. Polanski was away in Europe at the time.\nThe following night, members of Manson's group stabbed grocery owner Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary to death, using their blood to write, \"Death to Pigs\" and \"Healter Skelter\" - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\" - on the walls and refrigerator door.\nAlthough Manson did not personally kill any of the seven victims, he was found guilty of ordering their murders.\nHe was later convicted of ordering the murders of music teacher Gary Hinman, stabbed to death in July 1969, and stuntman Donald \"Shorty\" Shea, stabbed and bludgeoned that August.\nManson was sentenced to death for the Tate-LaBianca murders, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court abolished capital punishment in the state in 1972.\nBorn Charles Milles Maddox on Nov. 12, 1934, in Cincinnati to a 16-year-old girl, Manson spent much of his youth shuttled between relatives and juvenile detention halls. By age 13, he had been convicted of armed robbery.\nNewly paroled from prison in 1967, he began attracting members of his \"family\" in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, which had become a haven for the hippie youth culture.\nThe group moved with his followers to the Los Angeles area, eventually settling at Spahn Ranch, site of an outdoor movie location used for Western films and TV shows. Communal sex and drug use were a way of life as Manson became a messiah to the runaways, outcasts and criminals drawn by his charisma, intimidation and twisted spiritualism.\nOne follower told authorities she had seen Manson bring a bird back to life by breathing on it. Another said he could see and hear everything she did and said.\nManson aspired to be a rock star, and through one of his followers befriended Dennis Wilson, drummer of the Beach Boys, who would go on base their 1969 song \"Never Learn Not to Love\" on a Manson composition.\nWilson introduced Manson to music producer Terry Melcher, who later snubbed him. Melcher, along with his then-girlfriend, actress Candice Bergen, had previously rented the Benedict Canyon house.\nThe brutality of the killings stunned the nation.\n\"There was a lot of fear,\" Bugliosi, author of the chilling book about the murders, \"Helter Skelter,\" told the Times in 1994. \"The words printed in blood made it especially frightening for the Hollywood crowd.\"\nSENSATIONAL TRIAL\nDenied his request to represent himself during his 9-1/2 month trial, Manson showed up in court with an \"X\" carved into his forehead, and would later alter it into a swastika.\nCo-defendants Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel cut \"X\"s in their foreheads, shaved their scalps, sang Manson-written songs and giggled through chilling testimony.\nAt one point, Manson tried to leap over the defense table at the judge, snarling: \"In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut your head off.\" The judge began carrying a gun afterward.\nManson ultimately was brought down by his followers. Atkins told two inmates about the Tate-LaBianca murders while she was jailed in an unrelated killing, then testified to a grand jury before recanting. Prosecutors then persuaded another follower, Linda Kasabian, to testify against the rest of the group in exchange for immunity.\nConvicted along with Manson, his three co-defendants, Atkins, Van Houten and Krenwinkel, also had their death sentences reduced to life terms.\nManson long maintained his innocence, telling Rolling Stone magazine that follower Charles \"Tex\" Watson was responsible for the Tate-LaBianca killings. Watson was tried separately and is serving a life term for his role in those killings.\nStill, Manson seemed resigned to a life of incarceration, ceasing to even attend his parole review hearings after 1997.\n\"What would I want out for?\" he said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times. \"This beats an old folks home.\"\nIn April 2012, Manson was Quote: d by parole officials as having told a prison psychologist the previous fall: \"I have put five people in the grave. I've been in prison most of my life. I'm a very dangerous man.\"\n(Writing by Diane Bartz, Bill Trott and Steve Gorman; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Diane Craft and Nick Macfie)\nShare\nSave Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus",

      "text": "News Alerts US Mass Killer, Cult Leader Charles Manson Dies At 83 Manson, who died of natural causes, had been serving a life sentence at the Corcoran State Prison for ordering the murders of nine people, including actress Sharon Tate. World | Reuters | Updated: November 20, 2017 13:33 IST 1 Share PRINT COMMENTS Charles Manson with the scar of a swastika that he carved into his forehead decades earlier. (Reuters) Charles Manson, the wild-eyed cult leader who orchestrated a string of gruesome killings in Southern California by his \"family\" of young followers, shattering the peace-and-love ethos of the late 1960s, died on Sunday, prison officials said. He was 83.Manson died of natural causes Sunday evening at a Kern County hospital, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. It gave no further details of the circumstances surrounding his death.He had been serving a life sentence at the nearby Corcoran State Prison for ordering the murders of nine people, including actress Sharon Tate.Long after Manson had largely faded from headlines, he loomed large as a symbol of the terror he unleashed in the summer of 1969.\"The very name Manson has become a metaphor for evil,\" the late Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Manson, told the Los Angeles Times in 1994.A recent photograph showed the gray-bearded killer's face still bearing the scar of a swastika he carved into his forehead decades earlier.Manson became one of the 20th century's most notorious criminals when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war. GRAFFITI WITH VICTIMS' BLOOD Tate, aged 26 and eight months pregnant, was stabbed 16 times in the early morning hours of Aug. 9, 1969, by members of Manson's cult at the rented hillside house she shared with her husband, filmmaker Roman Polanski, in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles.Four friends of the celebrity couple, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring, were also stabbed or shot to death that night by Manson followers, who scrawled the word \"Pig\" in blood on the home's front door before leaving. Polanski was away in Europe at the time.The following night, members of Manson's group stabbed grocery owner Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary to death, using their blood to write, \"Death to Pigs\" and \"Healter Skelter\" - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\" - on the walls and refrigerator door.Although Manson did not personally kill any of the seven victims, he was found guilty of ordering their murders.He was later convicted of ordering the murders of music teacher Gary Hinman, stabbed to death in July 1969, and stuntman Donald \"Shorty\" Shea, stabbed and bludgeoned that August.Manson was sentenced to death for the Tate-LaBianca murders, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court abolished capital punishment in the state in 1972.Born Charles Milles Maddox on Nov. 12, 1934, in Cincinnati to a 16-year-old girl, Manson spent much of his youth shuttled between relatives and juvenile detention halls. By age 13, he had been convicted of armed robbery.Newly paroled from prison in 1967, he began attracting members of his \"family\" in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, which had become a haven for the hippie youth culture.The group moved with his followers to the Los Angeles area, eventually settling at Spahn Ranch, site of an outdoor movie location used for Western films and TV shows. Communal sex and drug use were a way of life as Manson became a messiah to the runaways, outcasts and criminals drawn by his charisma, intimidation and twisted spiritualism.One follower told authorities she had seen Manson bring a bird back to life by breathing on it. Another said he could see and hear everything she did and said.Manson aspired to be a rock star, and through one of his followers befriended Dennis Wilson, drummer of the Beach Boys, who would go on base their 1969 song \"Never Learn Not to Love\" on a Manson composition.Wilson introduced Manson to music producer Terry Melcher, who later snubbed him. Melcher, along with his then-girlfriend, actress Candice Bergen, had previously rented the Benedict Canyon house.The brutality of the killings stunned the nation.\"There was a lot of fear,\" Bugliosi, author of the chilling book about the murders, \"Helter Skelter,\" told the Times in 1994. \"The words printed in blood made it especially frightening for the Hollywood crowd.\" SENSATIONAL TRIAL Denied his request to represent himself during his 9-1/2 month trial, Manson showed up in court with an \"X\" carved into his forehead, and would later alter it into a swastika.Co-defendants Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel cut \"X\"s in their foreheads, shaved their scalps, sang Manson-written songs and giggled through chilling testimony.At one point, Manson tried to leap over the defense table at the judge, snarling: \"In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut your head off.\" The judge began carrying a gun afterward.Manson ultimately was brought down by his followers. Atkins told two inmates about the Tate-LaBianca murders while she was jailed in an unrelated killing, then testified to a grand jury before recanting. Prosecutors then persuaded another follower, Linda Kasabian, to testify against the rest of the group in exchange for immunity.Convicted along with Manson, his three co-defendants, Atkins, Van Houten and Krenwinkel, also had their death sentences reduced to life terms.Manson long maintained his innocence, telling Rolling Stone magazine that follower Charles \"Tex\" Watson was responsible for the Tate-LaBianca killings. Watson was tried separately and is serving a life term for his role in those killings.Still, Manson seemed resigned to a life of incarceration, ceasing to even attend his parole review hearings after 1997.\"What would I want out for?\" he said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times. \"This beats an old folks home.\"In April 2012, Manson was quoted by parole officials as having told a prison psychologist the previous fall: \"I have put five people in the grave. I've been in prison most of my life. I'm a very dangerous man.\" (Writing by Diane Bartz, Bill Trott and Steve Gorman; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Diane Craft and Nick Macfie) © Thomson Reuters 2017 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

      "text": "Had My Stepfather Picked Up a Gun and Killed Us All, Nobody Would Have Been Surprised Everybody in town knew about the abuse I survived growing up. Nobody said a thing. \nPhoto Credit: By nixki / Shutterstock.com It starts somewhere. It starts in the home. I know what a mass shooter can look like. First time I saw him, I was 13. The sun wasn’t even up yet and I was wearing my track uniform. I poured myself a bowl of Peanut Butter Captain Crunch, turned, and there he was, sitting at the round pale-blue Formica table reading the newspaper and drinking a cup of coffee. He was a large man. Wavy hair and beard intertwined with strands of black and white. Blue-blue eyes. A department store Santa. He smiled at me. Introduced himself. I was late for practice. So I told him to wash his dishes before he left. My mother met him the night before. The bowling alley was the place-to-be in our small town, with a crowded bar, nightly bowling leagues, giant trophies and a video game arcade. Normally we went with her, gorging on pizza and Dr. Pepper, but my youngest sister was sick. So my mom went alone, met him and brought him home. She’d been looking for a man for a while. She was a mother with three little girls. She did not have a job. That was a lot to take on for anyone. Her second marriage had ended a year earlier. He started sleeping in her bedroom every night after they met. A few weeks later, I woke up to find them both gone. It was Christmas Eve morning. She’d left a note. They had gone to Vegas, a four-hour drive. Watch your two younger sisters, please. They’d be back that night. I wasn’t mad. I was hopeful. She was lonely, she was drinking more and the laundry was piling up in the garage. He lifted her up, easily, and swung her around the room, happily, and he bought all three of us brand new bicycles. I wanted it to work out for her this time. We all did. I woke up before dawn on Christmas morning and they still hadn’t come home. The Christmas tree was decorated and the red and green lights were blinking expectantly, but the cookies and milk were untouched. I ate the cookies, drank the milk, and then stole her money from the cigar box. I rode my new banana seat bike that he bought me in the dark to the 7-Eleven on Grand Avenue, where I bought presents on behalf of Santa. I bought records for my two sisters. The 45’s of I Think I Love You by the Partridge Family and I Don’t Like Spiders and Snakes by Jim Stafford. The three of us had a band called “Wonder.” I played the drums on the back of a set of silver pots, while they played the tambourine and maracas. Our mother was best and only audience. At the store, I bought as much candy, soapy bubbles and plastic toys as I could afford. Then, I bought one more thing. A gift for my mother. The .45 record of You and Me Against the World by Helen Reddy. “When all the others turn their backs and walk away You can count on me to stay…” I wanted her to know I would stay. “And when one of us is gone And one of us is left to carry on Remembering will have to do…” I wanted her to know I would remember her. I rode my bike home as the sun rose. I wrapped the Christmas presents and put them under the tree. I quickly made pancakes, which my mother had always done for us on Christmas morning. My sisters woke up shortly after and opened their gifts. If they were disappointed in the small bounty, they didn’t say. We got out the silver pots, played the records and sang the songs. It was a happy Christmas morning. The only thing missing was our audience. My mother called hours later. They were driving back from Vegas. Would I find a restaurant open for Christmas dinner? Scouring the Yellow Pages, I made a reservation at a Chinese restaurant in the next town, and it was there my mother showed us her diamond ring and told us they were getting married. From that day forward, he lived with us. The changes happened rather fast. I never liked meat. Even as a very small child, my mother told me I would spit out beef. For dinner, my mother made meatloaf, his favorite. She gave me the side dishes: mashed potatoes, green beans, macaroni and cheese. He insisted I eat the meatloaf. I wouldn’t. My mother defended me. But he was the man of the house now. I could not leave the kitchen table until I ate the meatloaf. My mother shook me awake the next morning. I had fallen asleep. She had a black eye. I never saw him hit her. But I didn’t have to eat the meatloaf. He bought her a red Lotus, an expensive sports car with a stick shift. Then, they took another trip to Vegas and left us alone. I stole my mother’s car keys and drove my sisters to school in the brand new Lotus. I taught myself how to drive her stick shift, but not very well, because I hit a tree in the school parking lot. Students stared. Teachers stared. The car was towed. I was 14 and didn’t have a driver’s license. They called my mother in Vegas. She returned with a black eye, a split lip and a badly bruised arm hanging limply by her side. He walked right past me into the house without saying a word. She looked right at me and said, quietly, “I took it for you.” It was my fault I wrecked the car. It was my fault he beat her. My mother started drinking more. He started drinking more. The fights happened more. A passion play and we were the audience. Parenting became an afterthought. When the food in the house ran out, my sisters and I would take a taxi and my mother’s checkbook to the grocery store. We’d load up the shopping cart and not with very good choices. In front of the cashier, I’d carefully fill out the dollar amount on the check, and then forge my mother’s signature. It was a small town. Everybody knew why. But nobody said a thing. What we allow will continue. What continues will escalate. Life became a routine. When the fighting started downstairs, my younger sisters left their bedrooms and showed up in mine. The record player went on. The record collection grew. I learned which chair to wedge under the doorknob to keep my bedroom door shut. I learned which concealer worked best to hide her bruises the next morning. Sometimes, the ambulance would come. Sometimes, she’d wear dark sunglasses, a loose sweatshirt and a big floppy hat when she walked the dogs. Everybody knew. But nobody said a thing. What we allow will continue. What continues will escalate. There were moments of hope. Because nobody is angry and violent all day, every day. They just have to be angry and violent one day. My mother would wake us up in the middle of the night, and tell us to pack a suitcase. We’d hole up in a hotel. We were underworld spies, prisoners from a jailbreak. We’d order food, watch Charlie’s Angels, hope to never to be found. But we were never really lost, because a day or two later, he’d knock on the hotel door, carrying flowers. And it was over. Because who doesn’t want to go to Disneyland? Who doesn’t want to be the first house on the block to have a swimming pool? My mother hated guns, so there were no guns in our house. I slept with a butcher knife under my pillow. I used it once. I was 16. The fighting downstairs stopped, abruptly, in the middle of my mother’s scream. I called 911 and then I crept downstairs. He was hunched over her body. She was on the floor in a pool of her own blood. I put the knife to the back of his neck to stop him from killing my mother. The ambulance came and took her away. The police came and took him away. We snuck into a next door neighbor’s backyard and slept on their lawn furniture. We woke up with blankets. Of course, they knew. Everybody knew. But nobody said a thing. What we allow will continue. What continues will escalate. Weeks later, I was called out of my high school English class. My mother was at the school and wanted to talk to me. It was Halloween. I was a vampire, my long black cape flapping in the wind. She, newly released from the hospital, looked like a mummy, with her hollow eyes, her head shaved and her 32 stitches wrapped in white bandages. School was in session, so we were alone. She’d paid his bail. He was sorry. He was waiting at the house. Would I give him another chance, please? My mother came to my school, begging me not to break up with her. “When all the others turn their backs and walk away You can count on me to stay…” I broke my own heart when I did not come home from school that day. My mother could “take it” for me, but I couldn’t “take it” anymore. My middle sister, 13, ran away. Our father, remarried with two new small children, put her into a boarding school. My youngest sister, who had a different father from my mother’s second marriage, was only 6, so she cried herself to sleep at night. Our family was torn apart. So they moved to a new house on the outskirts of our small town on a secluded dirt road. Last time I saw him, I was 16. When I pulled up to the new house to get my things, he stepped outside to meet me. The beard was gone. He’d lost weight. He was calm. He held a shotgun in his hand. It was pointed down, non-threatening. There was finality in the moment. I was leaving home for good. There was finality in the presence of a weapon. If I was willing to use a knife, he was willing to use a gun. My sister was still in that house. My mother was still in that house. Everybody knew. Neighbors, coaches, grocery store cashiers, elementary, junior and high school teachers, school principals, classmates. Her parents knew, my father knew. Everybody knew. Nobody said a thing. What we allow will continue. What continues will escalate. I never saw my stepfather again. There is no big turning point moment here, where I confronted him about the abuse. Where I asked him, point blank, why did you beat my mother? Where I told him, point blank, the pain he caused my sisters and me could be forgiven, but it could never be undone. My mother left him a few years later. She died a few years after that. My stepfather did not murder my mother. My stepfather did not murder me. But had my stepfather picked up a gun and killed us all, nobody would have been surprised. He was a violent guy, they’d tell the news cameras. Everybody knew that. But nobody got involved. Because we somehow believe that we are safe from a guy who “only” beats his wife. We’re not a member of that family, so it doesn’t really affect us. Had my stepfather picked up a semi-automatic weapon and killed scores of strangers in a public place, nobody would have been surprised by that either. He was a violent guy, they’d tell the news cameras. Everybody knew that. But now everybody’s involved. Because innocent people have been killed in a church, in a nightclub, at a concert or a cafe, and in an elementary school. Domestic violence no longer lives inside that one house on the block. Domestic violence lives in the public now. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, the majority of all mass shooters in the United States killed an intimate partner or family member during the massacre or had a history of domestic violence. Somebody out there, right now, knows the next big mass shooter. Somebody out there is getting blamed, screamed at, beaten up. Somebody out there wants to believe that he’s sorry, that he’s changed and that love means giving him a second chance. Even if that second chance means giving him another bullet because he missed the first time. Somebody out there, right now, needs our help. Once, you could feel sorry for the three little girls from the violent home forging a check at the grocery store. Once, you could smile softly, avert your eyes and do nothing. Not anymore. The facts show that domestic violence is a very clear warning sign that people outside of the family might also be hurt in the future. Violent men don’t just drop out of the sky with guns and start shooting up people in public places. There are warning signs. Abused women and children are the canary in the coal mine. It starts somewhere. It starts in the home. Nobody would have been surprised if I had died. “And when one of us is gone And one of us is left to carry on Then remembering will have to do Our memories alone will get us through Think about the days of me and you Of you and me against the world I love you, Mommy I love you, baby…” \nActivist.

      "text": "Dieser Artikel wurde ausgedruckt unter der Adresse: www.tagesschau.de/ausland/manson-gestorben-101.html Sektenführer und Mörder Charles Manson ist tot Stand: 20.11.2017 10:20 Uhr Seitenanfang Er war Sektenführer und einer der berüchtigsten Mörder der USA: Nun ist Charles Manson im Alter von 83 Jahren gestorben. 1969 sorgte Manson weltweit für Entsetzen, als seine Anhänger die hochschwangere Schauspielerin Sharon Tate sowie sechs weitere Menschen töteten. Der US-Sektenführer und Kriminelle Charles Manson ist tot. Er starb am Sonntagabend in einem Krankenhaus in Kern County, wie die kalifornische Gefängnisbehörde mitteilte. Manson wurde 83 Jahre alt. Charles Manson gehörte zu den bekanntesten Kriminellen der amerikanischen Justizgeschichte. Er hatte nach eigener Aussage eine schwierige Kindheit. Die Mutter ging ins Gefängnis, als er fünf Jahre alt war. Er habe gelernt, niemanden etwas zu glauben, so Manson. Als junger Mann fiel er zunächst als Kleinkrimineller auf: Diebstahl, Betrug, später auch Zuhälterei. Er ging ins Gefängnis, kam auf Bewährung wieder frei. Charismatischer Kommunenanführer Ende der 1960er-Jahre ging er nach San Francisco. Es war die Zeit von Flower Power und Hippiekommunen. Manson versammelte eine Sekte um sich, die sogenannte Manson Family. Ihre Ansichten waren rassistisch geprägt. 1969 sorgte die Sekte weltweit für Entsetzen, als Mansons Anhänger die schwangere Schauspielerin Sharon Tate - die damalige Ehefrau von Regisseur Roman Polanski - brutal ermordeten. Mit ihr starben noch vier Gäste in ihrer Villa bei Los Angeles. In der folgenden Nacht wurden die Supermarktketten-Besitzer Leno und Rosemary LaBianca in deren Haus getötet. Sharon Tate und Roman Polanski an ihrem Hochzeitstag im Januar 1968 Todesstrafe wurde in lebenslange Haft umgewandelt Manson war nicht selbst am Tatort, wurde aber nach einem langen, spektakulären Mordprozess als Drahtzieher verurteilt. Als Mörder hat sich Manson selbst nie gesehen, erklärte er immer wieder in zahlreichen Interviews, die er im Gefängnis gegeben hat. \"Ich habe niemanden umgebracht\", sagte er. \"Ich habe Leute, die das für mich erledigen. Ich muss es nur denken\". Im Frühjahr 1971 erhielten Manson und seine engsten Anhänger die Todesstrafe. Nach Aussetzung der Todesstrafe in Kalifornien wurde das Strafmaß später in lebenslange Haft umgewandelt. Das letzte Foto von Charles Manson: Das Hakenkreuz, das er sich vor Jahrzehnten auf die Stirn tätowieren ließ, ist noch deutlich zu erkennen. Mansons Mitangeklagte Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel und Leslie Van Houten. Im Prozess sagte Manson aus, er habe einen \"Rassenkrieg\" anzetteln wollen, der seiner Meinung nach in dem Beatles-Song \"Helter Skelter\" vorhergesagt wurde. Im Laufe der Haft ließ er sich ein Hakenkreuz auf die Stirn tätowieren. Seine Anhänger kamen ihm auch im Gefängnis nicht abhanden: Weibliche Mitglieder, wie seine Mitangeklagten Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel und Leslie Van Houten, hielten während des Prozesses loyal zu Manson, den sie als \"Jesus Christus\" verehrten. Viele Frauen schrieben ihm Liebesbriefe. 2014 hatte Manson sogar nochmal Pläne zu heiraten, daraus wurde aber offenbar nichts. Auch in der Popkultur gibt es zahlreiche Referenzen - der Rockmusiker Marilyn Manson benannte sich unter anderem nach ihm. Keine Schuldgefühle Reue verspürte Manson auch Jahrzehnte später nicht. Es gebe keinen Grund sich schuldig zu fühlen, so Manson. Er habe nichts gemacht, wofür er sich schämen müsste. \"Ich hätte noch mehr Menschen töten sollen. So um die 500, dann würde ich mich jetzt besser fühlen. Dann hätte ich auch das Gefühl, der Gesellschaft was geboten haben.\" In vielen Interviews inszenierte sich Manson mal ungehalten, mal aggressiv oder verrückt. Zog Grimassen, schrie oder tanzte. Manson saß zuletzt im Staatsgefängnis von Kalifornien in Corcoran ein. Eine Freilassung auf Bewährung wurde ihm bereits ein Dutzend Mal verwehrt. Die nächste Bewährungsanhörung war für das Jahr 2027 angesetzt. Bereits längere Zeit hatte er gesundheitliche Probleme und war gerade erst in ein Krankenhaus eingeliefert worden. Dort starb er nach Behördenangaben eines natürlichen Todes.

Die nächste Bewährungsanhörung war für das Jahr 2027 angesetzt. \nDie Polizeifotos nach Mansons Festnahme zeigten einen Mann mit einem durchdringenden Blick und wirren, dunklen Locken, der sich später ein Hakenkreuz auf die Stirn tätowieren ließ. \nManson war ein Kleinkrimineller mit einem langen Vorstrafenregister, als er 1967 in San Franciscos Hippie-Szene als charismatischer Kommunenanführer Anhänger um sich scharte. Die \"Manson Family\" ließ sich dann in Südkalifornien nieder. \nWeibliche Mitglieder, wie seine Mitangeklagten Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel und Leslie Van Houten, hielten während des Prozesses loyal zu Manson, den sie als \"Jesus Christus\" verehrten. \nErst später gingen sie auf Distanz und bedauerten ihre Taten. Atkins starb 2009 im Alter von 61 Jahren im Gefängnis an Krebs. © dpa Kommentare 12 Aktualisiert am 20. November 2017, 07:29 Uhr Passende Suchen ",

      "text": "China-US military exercise to enhance rescues By LIA ZHU | China Daily | Updated: 2017-11-20 05:10 Chinese and US troops perform a joint confined-space rescue operation at Camp Rilea Armed Forces Training Facility of the Oregon Army National Guard in Warrenton, Oregon. YIN BOGU / XINHUA \nIt's a rare moment when you hear US soldiers shout commands in Chinese, and vice versa. \nBut at a military camp in Oregon, US and Chinese soldiers not only exchanged rescue methods but also commands during a joint exercise on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. \nTwo teams of eight soldiers, four from each side, were tasked to set up two rope bridges to transfer \"patients\" across a river in a flood-based simulation. \nNot far from the \"flood\" site, two groups of rescuers were performing a confined-space rescue operation at a \"rubble pile\". \n\"It's pretty fun, we teach each other some words. We had a lot of laughing,\" said Matthew Means, first lieutenant in charge of the simulated rescue operations. \nThe joint exercise between the Chinese and the US militaries, which was held from Thursday through Sunday at Camp Rilea Armed Forces Training Facility of the Oregon Army National Guard in Warrenton, Oregon, involved more than 200 people from both sides. Its goal was to improve response to natural disasters and deepen relations and cooperation between the sides. \n\"What we've learned is there are different methods to accomplish the same purpose. The PLA (People's Liberation Army) showed us different ways of tieing knots and setting up a rope bridge,\" said Means. \nHe said there were no better or worse methods. \"One way might be faster but less stable; the other way might be more secure but slower,\" he said. \"We can have the different methodologies in our toolbox to pull out when needed.\" \nThe US participants are from the US Army Pacific and the Chinese come from the PLA Southern Theater Command Army. To most of them, it's their first time participating in a joint exercise with another country. \nThis joint exercise is part of the consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. It also is part of the exchange mechanism between the two militaries. \nThis year marks the fifth practical field exchange on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief between the two sides since the exchanges were established in 1997. \n\"It's helpful that we can come together with another country in case of emergency or disaster to accomplish humanitarian missions,\" said Means. \"It broadened our horizons.\" \nWhat impressed Mo Sihua, a Chinese first lieutenant working at the rubble pile, the most during the exercise was the \"casualty collection point\" tactic from his US counterparts, which is more efficient and flexible. \nWhat also impressed him was the wild animals he saw at the camp and the local seafood the US soldiers brought them during the afternoon breaks. \n\"They (the US soldiers) are interested in learning Chinese from us, and they are pretty quick in picking up Chinese words,\" said Lei Yang, a deputy company commander. \n\"We learned a lot, too,\" he said. \"The old Chinese saying has it that no skill is a burden.\" Related Stories",

      "text": "Any 10-year-old who records her own video address to a United States president is usually seeking high marks in fifth grade civics. For Ronyde Christina Ponthieux, the message is much more poignant – a personal appeal to Donald Trump not to tear her family apart.\nWhile Ronyde is an American citizen, born and raised in Miami, her parents are not, and they face deportation if Trump follows an expected path and ends the temporary protected status (TPS) of more than 50,000 Haitian immigrants living legally in the US.\nAfter warning in May that Haitian TPS “beneficiaries” should begin preparing to leave , the Department of Homeland Security must announce by Thanksgiving Day its plans for the programme beyond the current January expiration date. \nImmigration advocates fear the Trump administration will declare that conditions in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake and subsequent cholera outbreak have improved sufficiently to order those granted interim sanctuary in the US under TPS to return.\n\nFamilies such as Ponthieux’s, with US-born children who have known no other home, would face unenviable choices: to split up if one or both parents are deported; try to build a new life together in an unfamiliar country where 80% of the population lives in poverty; or to sink into the shadows of an undocumented existence in the US, at risk of arrest, detention and removal.\n“They are not criminals – they are hardworking, honest people who just want a safe place to raise their families,” Ponthieux, a young leader with the advocacy group Fanm Ayisyen Nan Miyami (Haitian Women of Miami), tells Trump in her video calling for an extension of TPS for Haitians for a further 18 months.\n“They pay taxes, they contribute to the social, economic and political fabric of this great nation. Ending TPS would not only harm families, it would be bad for business and bad for the economy.”\n'Shameful': UK and US under fire over blocked funds for Haiti cholera victims Read more \nPonthieux’s father, Rony, 49, who is originally from Port-au-Prince and is a registered nurse at Miami’s Jackson Memorial hospital, said it would be heartbreaking for his children, including his 17-year-old son, Christopher, to leave behind their friends, and that the uncertainty had taken a toll on his family.\n“We’re concerned, particularly Ronyde. She is giving all of herself in the fight to renew TPS,” he said. “Sometimes I can’t sleep; I had a severe headache and had to go the emergency room. The doctor said I was too stressed. The uncertainty of TPS renewal put so much pressure on me that I feel sick.”\nSuch reactions are not uncommon: almost 275,000 US-born citizen children have been born to TPS recipients from Haiti, El Salvador and Honduras, according to the Center for Migration Studies , and some health experts have warned that worrying about separation can cause severe psychological or cognitive harm .\nEarlier this month, in terminating the TPS programme for thousands of Nicaraguans who fled to the US after Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and deferring a decision on 57,000 similarly affected Hondurans until July, the acting secretary of homeland security, Elaine Duke, acknowledged the “difficulties” families would face and called on Congress to find a permanent solution.\nLast week, Yvette Clarke, a Democratic congressional representative from New York; Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican; and Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, introduced a bill to protect TPS immigrants, hoping the so-called Aspire Act would attract bipartisan support by offering a path to permanent residency only to those who could prove they would face genuine hardship in their home country.\nImmigration campaigners, meanwhile, say the imminent decision about Haiti meant the clock was already ticking. “The time is now,” said Natalia Jaramillo of the advocacy group We Belong Together. \n“[TPS] is the last line of protection for these families. We cannot have more kids separated from their parents.”",

      "text": "﻿Cryptocurrency will survive as US dollar and euro collapse – BitCoin Cash ‘CEO’ Published time: 20 Nov, 2017 08:25 Edited time: 21 Nov, 2017 13:21 Rick Falkvinge, CEO of BitCoin Cash and founder of the Swedish Pirate Party \nThe digital currency Bitсoin, once a toy for computer nerds, is now soaring in price, triggering a new gold rush. Is it just another bubble, or a glimpse into a radically different financial future? We ask Rick Falkvinge, CEO of BitCoin Cash and founder of the Swedish Pirate Party. \nFollow @ SophieCo_RT \nSophie Shevardnadze : Rick Falkvinge, welcome to the show. It’s really great to have you in our program. You predicted Bitcoin’s a thousand-fold increase back in 2011 And indeed from 1 dollar in February 2011 hit a record high of almost 7880 dollars last week, then had a plunge, and is back up again now. Why does it keep growing - and is there any price limit for bitcoin? \nRick Falkvinge : Yes, there is a price limit for cryptocurrency. It cannot displace more money than exists in the world. So, there is an upper ceiling. But if you're just regarding bitcoin as a commodity on the market, which I think it is, like any currency, that upper ceiling can easily go up to 1 million or more per bitcoin. It’s important to remember that bitcoin might not be the final cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency will displace the central bank money. But with social networks - we had SixDegrees which was replaced by Friendster which was replaced by MySpace which was replaced by Facebook - some cryptocurrency is going to be worth a lot of money. Which one? Well, that’s a gamble. \nFull text \nSS : So we are having this Bitcoin split - without going into too much detail, we have two different versions of Bitcoin now. You’re the man behind the Bitcoin Cash - this new version of bitcoin - that was created, according to your organization in response to years of ‘mismanagement of the Bitcoin Legacy network’. Is Bitcoin’s decentralized nature its Achilles heel? Is it going to keep splintering because there will always be someone in the community who will be unhappy about the way it functions? \n\nRF : The key aspect of Bitcoin is that it is permission-less. You don’t need to ask anybody’s permission to do anything. And this is crucial to the entire community, which is why I decided to publish a letter where I was CEO without asking anybody’s permission - as a way to illustrate that we are not asking permission - that’s just part of our community. The person behind Bitcoin Cash would primarily be a French guy named Amaury Séchet, who started working on this, again, without asking anybody’s permission. \n\nSS : Now you don’t have to buy bitcoins, you can “mine” them - by using a high-powered processor like the one in a video card. And the gold rush is on - here in Moscow we’ve already had a video card shortage, you literally couldn’t find any in stores - everybody was buying them up to furnish bitcoin mining farms. But can bitcoin really make everybody rich? \n\nRF : No. Bitcoin cannot make everybody rich. Bitcoin right now is a huge wealth transfer to those who understand its implications early on. The last wealth transfer of this magnitude was around 1850, and it was about those who’d found oil. There’s a huge wealth transfer going on right now - where those who used to be poor, nerdy, geeky, sitting in their mom’s basement, if you like, are suddenly the new millionaires. And that, perhaps more than anything, is going to have a profound effect on what the future of our society looks like. Because for the last 200 years or so, it were the people who found oil that decided where money went, what research was made. And when the geeks and nerds are sitting on that money and deciding what research gets made - it’s not going to be a better diesel engine. It’s going to be a better solar panel, it’s going to be teleportation, space travel... I think that is going to be one of the more profound changes happening here. A wealth transfer to an entirely new type of people. \n\nSS : So can everyone jump on this bandwagon or is it too late? \n\nRF : It comes and goes. I can’t give financial advice, but if cryptocurrency fulfills its promise - and there’s no indication it wouldn’t - then the equivalent of one bitcoin needs be in the 2 to 5 million dollar range. But at that point it won’t make sense to measure it in US dollars, because USD won’t have any measureable value. So it’s absolutely not too late, just as it wasn’t too late when Bitcoin was at 3 dollars or at 30 dollars or at 300 dollars or at 3000 dollars. But this is a very highly volatile [financial] instrument. This is a really risky investment. And if you ask me whether anybody should invest, then the answer is nobody should ever invest in more than being capable of losing every single last cent of it. \n\nSS : Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein says Bitcoin may be another bubble just like that of the dotcoms, and JP Morgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon compares cryptocurrency to the Dutch 17st century tulip mania. Don’t these men have a point? I mean a bubble forms when there’s public ignorance and with Bitcoin most people have a vague idea of what it is and how it works… \n\nRF : I think you absolutely have a point that most people don’t really understand what Bitcoin is. It is ‘peer-to-peer electronic money’. That means I have a phone here. I can use that phone to transfer money to a nearby phone. Or to a phone on the other side of the planet. The transfer is instant, it is practically free. Nobody gets to decide whether I can make that transaction or not, including financial authorities. And that in itself will mean a financial revolution. This is an extinction level event for banks. Banks will no longer be a necessary middleman. And that’s, more than anything, why I believe that this is the future of finance. \n\nSS : Anonymity makes Bitcoin popular but it enables crime as well, just remember the notorious WannaCry ransomware attack this May. This can potentially make governments restrict Bitcoin trade substantially, and that would cause a drastic slump in its value. Do you think cryptocurrency can partially sacrifice its anonymity to ward off shady users? \n\nRF : It is more traceable than any money that came before it because every single unit of bitcoin is traceable through its entire monetary history - through anonymous accounts. But once you de-anonymize account you can start unravelling where the transactions go. The second part of that question, which is more interesting, is that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. A peer-to-peer technology means there’s no middleman. Governments have been trying to stop peer-to-peer technologies since Napster. And they have been as completely unsuccessful as anybody could possibly be in that. So I don’t see them being able to stop peer-to-peer currency either. Which leads me to the last observation. Since there’s no middleman, there’s nobody giving permission. When I’m buying a bottle of water with a credit card someone in the background there’s a bank giving me permission to buy a bottle of water with a credit card. And that is a horrifying thought. Because that means that the bank can also deny me permission to buy a bottle of water. Nobody thinks of this, but it’s there. With Bitcoin this is not true. There is nobody needing to give permission in the background. There’s nobody who gets to say no to a transaction. No money can be forced. No money can be seized. And here’s a big problem for governments in the future. Taxes can no longer be forced. \n\nSS : I get all the three points that you’ve said. Like you’ve said before, it’s traceable. With WannaCry, we know where the ransom money is going, but the accounts themselves are anonymous. But if we know that there is an account with ransom money extorted from ordinary users, shouldn’t we have the ability to freeze an account and take it back? \n\nRF : No! Why should you? \n\nSS : Doesn’t it bother you that here you are, working on a new invention, a beautiful convenient currency, and people use it to pay for child pornography or to order a hit on someone? \n\nRF : Actually, they use the US dollar for that. And yet I’ve never heard somebody arguing against the existence of the US dollar with that argument. If you’re going after drugs and narcotics trade, then the US dollar is unparalleled in use. And I’ve never heard that being used as an argument against the US dollar. \n\nSS : Will the complete implementation of cryptocurrency make compulsory taxation impossible? What happens to real life governments then? Will Bitcoin make them obsolete? Is that what you hope for? \n\nRF : Isn’t that interesting? I can’t predict that. The changes we’re about to see are so profound that you can no longer just go in and take somebody’s money. But the worst you can do as a government is to make them sorry for not giving them your money. You cannot force it, you cannot seize it. The changes that it’s going to bring are so profound to society that we’re going to see a lot of governments panicking when they realize they can no longer just seize any money they want. \n\nSS : Do you think the governments can come up with their own version of a blockchain currency, make it traceable, registered, and ensure nobody ever evades taxes or fines or hides their profit? I know banks are trying to, Citigroup, for instance, is definitely doing it right now. \n\nRF : There are governments and banks trying. There was this sort of mantra or cliche last year, and a year before last, that it’s not about Bitcoin. It’s about the underlying innovation of Bitcoin, called the Blockchain, which is a solution to a really hard problem, which is essentially, how do you make sure a lot of people agree on everybody’s account balances. Because there’s obviously an interest in somebody saying “No, I have more money” and everybody else needs not to agree with that. Governments and banks don’t really think in this way. Banks and governments think that they can start a blockchain currency and issue more money down the road. But the whole point of the Blockchain technology is that you’re trusting mathematics, not the issuer. In this way, a blockchain currency vs a central bank currency is a lot like open-source software vs proprietary software, like Apple MacOS or Microsoft Windows. It took 30 years, but in the end, pretty much every single computer web-server is running an open operating system. In the same way, I predict that we will go from proprietary money to open money and permission-less money like Bitcoin. \n\nSS : Bitcoin enthusiasts say the cryptocurrency will eventually replace all regular currencies, become the world’s only money. But can cryptocurrencies really work for everyone in the world? An internet connection isn’t a permanent thing. People in a Sri Lankan jungle aren’t online all the time for example. And half of African people don’t even know what a cellphone is. \n\nRF : A 100 years we asked ‘but what about certain places without electricity, how will you use an electrical engine then?’ And today there is electricity in most places, and where there isn’t electricity there are batteries. There are some special cases when you go camping, hiking, when you go on a survival training, where you don’t have electricity or the Internet the way you take them for granted. But, overall, I don’t see it as a long-term concern, that you won’t have access to the Internet because just as we speak there is a network of satellites being planned, to put the Internet on every spot on the globe. \n\nSS : A top Deutsche Bank strategist says the current monetary system is too unstable and prone to high inflation so that it’s doomed to fail. Will cryptocurrency fill in the vacuum if that is so? How will it change banking? \n\nRF : I think you’re spot on there. The European Central Bank used to print 80 billion euros per month just propping up a gigantic bubble happening right now. It doesn’t do that anymore, it just prints 60 billion euros per month. The US Federal Reserve was printing trillions of dollars inflating the money supply. We know how this ends. Once a government starts printing money to pay off its own debt, the story doesn’t have a happy ending anymore. It just doesn’t. History is brutal on this point. So cryptocurrency doesn’t really need to replace the US dollar, replace the euro. It just needs to survive while these behemoths collapse under their own weight. And when it happens, it’s going to go fast. \n\nSS : Will the widespread use of cryptocurrency, while promising a new level of liberty, actually discriminate older generations? It won’t be easy for older folks to get used to this complicated digital stuff, will it disadvantage them in the end? \n\nRF : It is complicated. It is too complicated, it is not useable enough at all. And I agree that this has always been something of a problem. In the 1920’s when households were electrified there was a training curve where the older folks were being shut out from all these new electrical appliances, because they had to re-learn so much. When computers arrived, it was the same thing. When smartphones arrived, it was the same thing. There’s always a problem where a younger generation needs to take responsibility of introducing the elders to the ongoing changes of society. Fortunately, there’s usually somebody in every family who does that. But the concern is absolutely valid. \n\nSS : The first time Bitcoin was used to pay for a real service it cost a user 10 000 bitcoin to get two pizzas - that’s worth 70 million dollars now, 35 million per pizza (I wonder if that man really wishes he’d cook at home…) Cash is backed by, theoretically, gold, or the government’s ability to pay debts, where do all these insane values come from in Bitcoin? \n\nRF : What’s backing a Bitcoin? Like any commodity, it has value because of two simple characteristics. It is useful and it is scarce, which means there’s not an infinite supply of it. It is useful because I can use it to transfer value to Malaysia on a Sunday, without anybody interfering with that transmission. And it’s finite, because there’s only ever going to be about 21 million Bitcoin. Those two things make it valuable. Not that it’s backed by the government, because it isn’t. In that way, it’s kind of like gold. \n\nSS : There have been many cases of bitcoin theft - with this latest BTC-e case, we have a suspect accused of stealing tens of millions of dollars-worth of bitcoin - is it not really safe to keep your investments in it, considering that the hype about its rising value surely attracts hackers like flies to honey? \n\nRF : Bitcoin has that problem. It’s really hard to store your Bitcoin securely. It is a really hard problem that has not been solved. Some of the best solutions involve specialized hardware that you keep on your wrist. Some other solutions involve opening up a laptop and taking out the wi-fi circuit to make sure it cannot ever connect to the Internet or be infiltrated from the outside. This is hard today but it is going to become useable. These are really hard problems. And everybody in this community knows that whoever solves this first would become really rich. As in insanely rich! And so there’s a lot of money being thrown at this problem. \n\nSS : That’s a good incentive to stick to the Bitcoin business. It’s not just the hackers that are the problem. A famous case of a Wire editor forgetting his PIN-code from his bitcoin wallet and using hackers and even a hypnotist to retrieve it! I know it sounds funny, but isn’t it a little harsh on people - how come it’s so easy to lose access to something you own? That can’t happen to my wallet, or bank account. \n\nRF : It absolutely can happen to your bank account. Ask the people on Cyprus, when their bank savings were confiscated to bail out the government’s bank. Ask the people in, say, Argentina or, for that matter, any person in South America how safe their bank holdings are. They are not. They’re just not. \n\nSS : Maybe it wasn’t a good example. The whole bank business is still really tied to whatever crisis going in the country, but you’re saying the advantage of Bitcoin is that it’s not tied to anything that’s going around it in the world. So how can it be so easy to lose access to it? To something that you own, just by forgetting a PIN-code? \n\nRF : It is data. You can think of it as a file, if you like. If that file gets into somebody else’s hands - then you lose your money. If the hard drive with that file on it gets destroyed or corrupted or just dies - then you lose your money. Which is why this problem is so hard. Which is also why a lot of people are working on it. But Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are just in their infancy. This problem is going to be solved, just like every technical problem before it that had so much promise but hadn’t yet got its usability. We were there with streaming video for 10 years before YouTube hit in 2006. We were there with blogging for 10 years before WordPress and Typepad hit. We were there for about 10 years with file sharing before Napster hit in 1999. These things take about 10 years before somebody hits the right usability key. And remember, this is a technology that was devised in 2009. It’s possible that, if we’re looking at a possible mainstream breakthrough around 2019, ten years from then, then the company which will make this breakthrough has not been even founded yet. \n\nSS : Rick, for all the talk of being an internet freedom banner, bitcoin isn’t entirely independent, for example, the U.S. police has recently seized accounts of clients of the BTC-e marketplace and arrested one of its founders. So pressure can be put on cryptocurrency - can it be brought to heel? \n\nRF: You cannot point a gun at a computer to make it give up its secrets. But you can point a gun at the computer’s owner and make them very sorry for not giving up that file inside the computer. But this difference, that might seem very small, has profound effects. Because it means that governments can no longer just walk in and seize money to pay people’s taxes. People have to actually agree with paying taxes. And that in itself is going to be profound when governments realize this. \n\nSS: Right, Rick, thank you very much for this interesting insight, for this interview. We were talking to Rick Falkvinge, CEO of BitCoin Cash, founder of the Swedish Pirate Party and cryptocurrency evangelist, discussing Bitcoin and the future of finance. That’s it for this edition of SophieCo, I’ll see you next time.",

Reuters The US is determined to keep its dominance of the air with stealth bomber technology in face of stiff competition from Russia \nCurrently the Russians are producing “shadow” aircraft which are able to sometimes vanish from radar. \nBut the Pentagon wants to go one step further and fit bat-like warplanes with a device akin to the Klingon cloaking system, reports The Times. \nThey want to be able to render surface-to-air missiles useless and make it impossible for intercepting jets to track them. \nAdvanced radar-absorbing material is being developed for the frame of B-21 bombers as well as a new cooling system for cutting the aircraft’s heat signature. \nEach cost an estimated $550 million (£415million) and they are under development at Plant 42. AFP - Getty Once picked up on radar any warplane is in immediate danger \nMore than 5,000 staff work at the huge, heavily guarded facility in the Californian desert northeast of Los Angeles. \nColonel Mace Carpenter, a veteran combat pilot who flew America’s first stealth aircraft, the F-117 Nighthawk, said it would be amazing if a cloaking device could be make a plane “disappear”. \nHe said: “Stealth is not about making an aircraft completely unseen but harder to see.” Russia reveals hypersonic stealth bomber that can launch nuclear attacks from space U.S. Navy's new stealth destroyer, the USS Zumwalt sets sail from Maine shipyard MOST READ IN NEWS Adult film star Madison Missina says porn sex is painful and 'the worst' BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN Morrissey defends Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weinstein and even PAEDOS KIM JONG-ILL?

      "title": "If you tax the rich, they won't leave: US data contradicts millionaires' threats | Inequality | The Guardian",
      "text": "In the classic Ayn Rand novel Atlas Shrugged , the rich go “on strike” – withdrawing their services and disappearing from society in protest against taxes and regulation. Weary of carrying an ungrateful world on their shoulders, business leaders and other top income earners finally shrug, and leave the world without them.\nThe book’s metaphor inspires political rhetoric to this day: if you tax the rich, they will leave. Variations on the threat are issued by well-off individuals all over the world – not least in the United States, where each state sets its own tax policies, and periodic warnings are issued that taxes on the rich will lead to millionaire migration to more obliging US states.\nWhen Oregon voters passed a millionaire tax at the start of this decade, for example, the state’s richest resident, Nike CEO Phil Knight, warned the tax would set off a “ death spiral … in which thousands of our most successful residents will leave”. As California considered similar taxes, policymakers cautioned “nothing is more mobile than a millionaire and his money”. In New Jersey, governor Chris Christie simply stated : “Ladies and Gentlemen, if you tax them, they will leave.”\nBut does this rhetoric stand up to statistical scrutiny? To better understand elite migration across state lines, I analysed tax return data from every million-dollar income-earner in the United States. The dataset includes 3.7 million top-earning individuals, who collectively filed more than 45 million tax returns over more than a dozen years – showing where millionaires live and where they move to.\nAnd it turns out that place still matters for the rich – much more so than we might think.\nOnly about 2.4% of US-based millionaires change their state of residence in a given year. Interstate migration is actually more common among the US middle class, and almost twice as common among its poorest residents, who have an annual interstate migration rate of 4.5%.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Source: US Department of the Treasury (1999-2011)\nWhile travel may be a classic “luxury good”, migration is not. Moving one’s home, life and family to a different place is mostly about people who have a poor economic fit with where they live, earn below-market incomes, and are struggling to find a livelihood. Higher income earners show low migration levels because they are not searching for economic success – they’ve already found it.\nWhen millionaires do move, they admittedly tend to favour lower-tax states over higher-tax ones – but only marginally so. Around 15% of interstate millionaire migrations bring a net tax advantage. The other 85% have no net tax impact for the movers.\nFurthermore, almost all of the tax-migration moves are to just one low-tax state: Florida – where low-income taxes comingle with sun, sand and palm trees. Other low-tax states such as Texas, Tennessee and Nevada do not pick up any net tax-migration. So while some millionaires have moved to lower tax states over the years 1999-2011, the flows have been too small to change the geography of the economic elite in America.\nThe world view The Forbes list of the world’s billionaires offers an international look at elite migration, and takes us higher up the food chain to the greatest corners of wealth.\nAnalysis of this list shows most of the world’s billionaires – about 84% – still live in their country of birth. And among those who do live abroad, most moved to their current country of residence long before they became wealthy – either as children with their parents, or as students going abroad to study (and then staying).\nThe world’s billionaires largely live where they were born or where they began their careers\nOnly about 5% of world billionaires moved abroad after they became successful. These individuals readily fit the stereotype of a “transnational capitalist class” – unplugged from their nation state, travelling the world for some combination of tax avoidance and cosmopolitan lifestyle.\nMany of them can be found in London claiming “non-dom” status to avoid the tax laws of both their homeland and those that apply to British citizens. Others are located in tropical tax havens – such as Sir Richard Branson, who moved to the British Virgin Islands after becoming a billionaire.\nThese jet-setting billionaires generate a lot of headlines and cynicism about tax flight . But they are anecdotal exceptions. The world’s billionaires largely live where they were born or where they began their careers. The British elite live in Britain, the Chinese elite live in China, and the American elite live in America. After making it on to the Forbes billionaire list, elites are actually more likely to die than to move to a different country.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Source: American Community Survey (2005-14)\nWhy do the rich have such low migration rates? And why is common intuition about elite migration so wrong? It turns out that education is a big part of the remaining puzzle.\nPeople with high levels of education have very high mobility – but only for a short period after finishing their education. If you know people who have been geographically mobile, the chances are they have a higher-level education. However, once they have made a solid start to their career, the chances are also that they will not move again.\nMillionaire tax revenues could be used to invest in things that matter to young people starting out\nMigration is a young person’s game, and moving overwhelmingly occurs when people are starting their careers. By the time people hit their early forties, PhDs, college grads and high school drop-outs all show the same low rate of migration.\nTypically, millionaires are society’s highly educated at an advanced career stage. They are typically the late-career working rich: established professionals in management, finance, consulting, medicine, law and similar fields. And they have low migration because they are both socially and economically embedded in place.\nIn the US tax data, while most of the millionaires’ incomes come from wages and salaries, a quarter of them also own a business. Almost all of them are married, and most have children at home. For all these reasons, places are sticky – it is hard to move after making a career and family in a place.\nIf millionaires were mostly college-going twentysomethings not yet tied to place by career or family responsibilities, place-based income tax systems would face serious challenges. We would be trying to tax the rich exactly when they are most mobile. But this is not the case. Typically, people make decisions about where to live almost two decades before they hit their peak earnings.\nThis shows a kind of unexpected genius behind taxes on the very highest incomes. A tax on million-dollar income serves as an intergenerational transfer, since those who pay it are the late-career working rich: socially and economically embedded in the place.\nThe Inequality Project: the Guardian's in-depth look at our unequal world Read more\nIn contrast, most of the people who are mobile – early career professionals – do not really care about the “millionaire tax”, because if they ever pay it, it will be decades in the future, and only if they are wildly successful.\nMillionaire tax revenues could be used to invest in things that matter to young people starting out: education, infrastructure, public services, urban amenities, quality of life. And this would help to attract and retain a pipeline of future top-earners, creating a virtuous tax circle.\nThis is why places with highly progressive income taxes – such as New York and California – still thrive as centres for talent and elite economic success. Their policies focus on the pipeline of future top earners. They invest in what attracts mobile young professionals – quality of life – and only send them the bill if and when they achieve their highest aspirations.\nCristobal Young is the author of The Myth of Millionaire Tax Flight: How Place Still Matters for the Rich (Stanford University Press). He will be in conversation with Ed Miliband MP at the London School of Economics from 6.30pm today\nFollow the Inequality Project on Twitter here Topics Inequality Tax and spending Income inequality US income inequality",

[Photo/Xinhua] \nPORTLAND, United States - Chinese and US armies ended their 13th annual China-US Disaster Management Exchange Table Top Exchange (TTE) and practical field training Sunday in Portland, Oregon on the western US coast. \nZhang Jian, army commander of the Southern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), said at the closing ceremony that the exchanges between Chinese and US armies on humanitarian disaster relief and rescue have boosted their mutual trust over the past 20 years. \nChina and the United States, as two major powers in the world, should work hand in hand to jointly respond to risks and challenges, and make their due contributions to human development, said Zhang. \nThe Chinese army is willing to work with the US side to deepen their practical cooperation on non-traditional challenges such as humanitarian relief and disaster management, in a bid to safeguard world and regional peace and stability, he added. \nRobert Brown, US Army Pacific commander, said on the same occasion that the US-China exchanges on humanitarian disaster management carry vital significance for deepening the practical cooperation between China and the United States as well as their militaries. \nHe expressed the hope that the United States and China will continue their joint efforts to push forward military-to-military exchanges, academic discussions and practical training on humanitarian disaster management, so as to further improve their coordination capabilities in joint response to disaster relief and rescue operations. \nBrown said he is confident about closer cooperation between Chinese and US armies in the future. \nThe week-long training began on Nov 13 at the Camp Rilea Armed Forces Training Facility of the Oregon Army National Guard in Portland, the largest city in Oregon.

      "text": "Englishmate Charles Manson, US cult leader who ordered his followers to kill, dies at 83 Manson’s ‘family’ of supporters killed Sharon Tate, who was nearly nine months pregnant and was found stabbed repeatedly in her Hollywood mansion, along with several of her friends. world Updated: Nov 20, 2017 11:55 IST AP, Los Angeles Charles Manson, the cult leader who sent followers known as the \"Manson Family\" out to commit gruesome murders, currently being held at California State Prison, Corcoran, California.(Reuters File Photo) \nCharles Manson, the hippie cult leader who became the hypnotic-eyed face of evil across America after orchestrating the gruesome murders of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others in Los Angeles during the summer of 1969, died Sunday after nearly a half-century in prison. He was 83. \nManson, whose name to this day synonymous with unspeakable violence and madness, died of natural causes at Kern County hospital, according to a California Department of Corrections statement. \nA petty criminal who had been in and out of jail since childhood, the charismatic, guru-like Manson surrounded himself in the 1960s with runaways and other lost souls and then sent his disciples to butcher some of LA’s rich and famous in what prosecutors said was a bid to trigger a race war — an idea he got from a twisted reading of the Beatles song “Helter Skelter”. \nThe slayings horrified the world and, together with the deadly violence that erupted later in 1969 during a Rolling Stones concert at California’s Altamont Speedway, exposed the dangerous, drugged-out underside of the counterculture movement and seemed to mark the death of the era of peace and love. \nDespite the overwhelming evidence against him, Manson maintained during his tumultuous trial in 1970 that he was innocent and that society itself was guilty. \n“These children that come at you with knives, they are your children. You taught them; I didn’t teach them. I just tried to help them stand up,” he said in a courtroom soliloquy. Charles Manson reacts to photographers as he goes to lunch after an outbreak in court that resulted in his ejection, along with three female co-defendants, in the Sharon Tate murder trial. (AP File Photo) \nThe Manson Family, as his followers were called, slaughtered five of its victims on August 9, 1969, at Tate’s home: the actress, who was 8½ months pregnant, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, celebrity hairdresser Jay Sebring, Polish movie director Voityck Frykowski and Steven Parent, a friend of the estate’s caretaker. Tate’s husband, “Rosemary’s Baby” director Roman Polanski, was out of the country at the time. \nThe next night, a wealthy grocer and his wife, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, were stabbed to death in their home across town. \nThe killers scrawled such phrases as “Pigs” and “Healter Skelter” (sic) in blood at the crime scenes. \nThree months later, a Manson follower was jailed on an unrelated charge and told a cell mate about the bloodbath, leading to the cult leader’s arrest. \nIn the annals of American crime, Manson became the embodiment of evil, a short, shaggy-haired, bearded figure with a demonic stare and an “X’’— later turned into a swastika — carved into his forehead. \n“Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969,” author Joan Didion wrote in her 1979 book “The White Album.” \nAfter a trial that lasted nearly a year, Manson and three followers — Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten — were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Another defendant, Charles “Tex” Watson, was convicted later. All were spared execution and given life sentences after the California Supreme Court struck down the death penalty in 1972. \nAtkins died behind bars in 2009. Krenwinkel, Van Houten and Watson remain in prison. \nAnother Manson devotee, Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, tried to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975, but her gun jammed. She served 34 years in prison. \nManson was born in Cincinnati on November 12, 1934, to a teenager, possibly a prostitute, and was in reform school by the time he was 8. After serving a 10-year sentence for check forgery in the 1960s, Manson was said to have pleaded with authorities not to release him because he considered prison home. \n“My father is the jailhouse. My father is your system,” he would later say in a monologue on the witness stand. “I am only what you made me. I am only a reflection of you.” \nHe was set free in San Francisco during the heyday of the hippie movement in the city’s Haight-Ashbury section, and though he was in his mid-30s by then, he began collecting followers — mostly women — who likened him to Jesus Christ. Most were teenagers; many came from good homes but were at odds with their parents. \nThe “family” eventually established a commune-like base at the Spahn Ranch, a ramshackle former movie location outside Los Angeles, where Manson manipulated his followers with drugs, supervised orgies and subjected them to bizarre lectures. \nHe had musical ambitions and befriended rock stars, including Beach Boy Dennis Wilson. He also met Terry Melcher, a music producer who had lived in the same house that Polanski and Tate later rented. \nBy the summer 1969, Manson had failed to sell his songs, and the rejection was later seen as a trigger for the violence. He complained that Wilson took a Manson song called “Cease to Exist,” revised it into “Never Learn Not to Love” and recorded it with the Beach Boys without giving Manson credit. \nManson was obsessed with Beatles music, particularly “Piggies” and “Helter Skelter,” a hard-rocking song that he interpreted as forecasting the end of the world. He told his followers that “Helter Skelter is coming down” and predicted a race war would destroy the planet. \n“Everybody attached themselves to us, whether it was our fault or not,” the Beatles’ George Harrison, who wrote “Piggies,” later said of the murders. “It was upsetting to be associated with something so sleazy as Charles Manson.” Charles Manson is escorted to his arraignment on conspiracy-murder charges in connection with the Sharon Tate murder case. (AP File Photo) \nAccording to testimony, Manson sent his devotees out on the night of Tate’s murder with instructions to “do something witchy.” The state’s star witness, Linda Kasabian, who was granted immunity, testified that Manson tied up the LaBiancas, then ordered his followers to kill. But Manson insisted: “I have killed no one, and I have ordered no one to be killed.” \nHis trial was nearly scuttled when President Richard Nixon said Manson was “guilty, directly or indirectly.” Manson grabbed a newspaper and held up the front-page headline for jurors to read: “Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares.” Attorneys demanded a mistrial but were turned down. \nFrom then on, jurors, sequestered at a hotel for 10 months, travelled to and from the courtroom in buses with blacked-out windows so they could not read the headlines on news stands. \nManson was also later convicted of the slayings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald “Shorty” Shea. \nOver the decades, Manson and his followers appeared sporadically at parole hearings, where their bids for freedom were repeatedly rejected. The women suggested they had been rehabilitated, but Manson himself stopped attending, saying prison had become his home. \nThe killings inspired movies and TV shows, and Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi wrote a best-selling book about the murders, “Helter Skelter.” The macabre shock rocker Marilyn Manson borrowed part of his stage name from the killer. \n“The Manson case, to this day, remains one of the most chilling in crime history,” prominent criminal justice reporter Theo Wilson wrote in her 1998 memoir, “Headline Justice: Inside the Courtroom — The Country’s Most Controversial Trials .” \n“Even people who were not yet born when the murders took place,” Wilson wrote, “know the name Charles Manson, and shudder.” ",

US Marine Corps The US military has barred troops in Japan from drinking alcohol or leaving their residences after a US Marine in Okinawa was accused of killing a local man in a car crash. The Japanese police said the Marine had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood at the time of the crash. The US has 50,000 troops in Japan, but drunken-driving incidents breed resentment among the local population. \nThe US military has indefinitely barred service members from drinking alcohol after a US Marine fatally struck an Okinawa man in a collision of two vehicles Sunday in which \"alcohol may have been a factor,\" according to a statement . \nThe US Forces Japan also declared all service members \"restricted to base and to their residences\" after the crash. A Japanese police official told Reuters the 21-year-old Marine had three times the legal level of alcohol in his blood at the time of the crash. \nUS service members in Japan have bred resentment among the local population with DUI convictions and alcohol-related deaths. About half of the US's 50,000 troops in Japan live in Okinawa. \n\"Commanders across Japan will immediately lead mandatory training to address responsible alcohol use, risk management and acceptable behavior. All military members and U.S. government civilians in Japan are required to attend,\" the statement said. \n\"The Defence and Foreign Ministries have lodged a stern representation to the U.S. forces in Japan and the U.S. embassy in Japan, asking for the enforcement of discipline, prevention of recurrence and sincere response to the bereaved,\" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference on Monday, according to Reuters. \nThe US maintains a large military presence in Japan and South Korea partially to contain North Korea and balance the regional influence of China.

SHARE Australian Justine Damond was fatally shot by police in Minneapolis. Photo: AP \nHer fiance, Don Damond, who was on the phone to Ms Ruszczyk in the moments before her death, told ABC's Australian Story on Monday night that he still struggled to comprehend how the act of dialling 911 for help could lead to such a tragedy. \nThe night she died Ms Ruszczyk called Mr Damond after being spooked by noises she believed related to a sexual assault in the laneway.

By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \n\"There's a number of things that had to line up for this to happen in the way that it did,\" Mr Damond said. \n\"I was away. I was out of town on a business trip, on a Saturday. That night I told Justine to call 911, I had this conception that when she said, 'the police are here,' I felt like all is well, like the knights in shining armour have arrived. I'll never feel that way again.\" \nMinneapolis civil rights lawyer Robert Bennett, who is acting for the family, said a decision about criminal charges was unlikely to be rushed by Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. \nHe said it was the worst example of excessive force he'd ever seen. \n\"It's a use of force so beyond the pale that it would cause other people not to call the police,\" he said. \n\"That's what outlines this as something unique. There's no excuse for it. If she can be shot, anybody can be shot. Any 911 caller, any mother in her pyjamas, anybody can be shot. \n\"You can't just say it's an accident. I can't imagine that they teach officers that one of the good lines of fire is across the lap of their driving partner. I mean, it's just crazy. \n\"In Minnesota we've never convicted an officer for any form of homicide or manslaughter in connection with an officer-involved shooting, or other killing of the suspect. \n\"I would charge someone in Justine's case.\" \n​Criminal justice advocate Jason Sole said the US had an entrenched problem with police violence. \n\"In no just society should you be the one calling police for help and end up dead,\" he said. \"We have a longstanding problem and it's time for us to fix it.\" \nHe detailed the case of Philando Castille, an African-American man shot and killed during a traffic stop. \nThere was outcry across the African-American community when the officer responsible escaped conviction. \nSince 2000, 162 people have died in encounters with the Minnesota police. \nCharges have been laid against only one Minnesota police officer and he was never convicted of the shooting. \nHer father, John Ruszczyk, vowed the family would not rest until the truth came out and somebody was held accountable for her death. \n\"This event has changed my life. It's stolen 40 years of my daughter's life. That's a very big crime as I see it,\" he said. \"She would have wanted us to go to the end, of seeing some change. And her death is not something that can be washed away.\" \n​",

      "text": "0 0 compartilhamentos \nNem dá para dizer que o bitcoin é a moeda do futuro, afinal ela já registra feitos incríveis agora mesmo, no presente. Mais um exemplo disso é o seu último recorde de valorização alcançado na noite deste domingo (19), quando a criptomoeda ultrapassou a barreira dos US$ 8 mil e chegou a ser negociada a US$ 8.101,91 a unidade. \nNo início desta segunda-feira (20), a moeda que foi chamada de fraudulenta pelo presidente do JP Morgan diminuiu a sua cotação, mas ainda assim permaneceu acima dos US$ 8 mil. O mais curioso é que ela sofria uma queda significativa há cerca de uma semana, quando um grande volume de bitcoin foi comercializado e reduziu o seu valor para algo em torno de US$ 5,5 mil. \nBitcoin volta a bater recorde e é comercializado a mais de US$ 8 mil. \nA desvalorização teve como origem também uma proposta de upgrade na rede bitcoin. Inicialmente planejada para o dia 16 de novembro, a sua execução teria resultado em um evento conhecido como hard fork , com a criação de uma nova versão da criptomoeda. Entretanto, a mudança foi cancelada e isso voltou a dar forças para a valorização do bitcoin. \nDe acordo com a CNBC , a valorização veio graças a pelo menos dois motivos. Um deles é a regulamentação da criptomoeda no Japão, indo na contramão de outros países asiáticos, como Coreia do Sul e China, que vem fechando o cerco em torno do bitcoin. Outro, foi o interesse de investidores como o CME Group também pode ter contribuído para elevar o preço da moeda. \nAinda no último mês, as previsões eram de que o bitcoin ultrapassasse o valor dos US$ 8 mil até o fim de novembro. \nCupons de desconto TecMundo: ",

      "text": "Can Argentina replicate the US shale boom?   11:48 Get short URL © Jim Urquhart / Reuters Argentina has consistently been hyped as the location where the next shale revolution will unfold. The unfolding has taken some time, but progress in shale production is starting to take off in the South American nation. \nIn October, state-owned YPF announced plans to spend $30 billion on shale investment over the next five years in an effort to scale up oil and gas production from the Vaca Muerta shale. The company hopes to boost shale output by 150 percent over that timeframe. Read more Oil prices could double if Middle East conflict escalates \nKey to that push is lowering development costs. YPF says that it can produce a barrel of oil equivalent (boe) for $13, and it aims to reduce that to $10/boe by 2020, which the company says would make it competitive with shale production from the Permian or Eagle Ford. \nPart of the cost cutting drive, the company and the government believe, will be lowering labor costs. Earlier this year, trade unions made concessions on working contracts in exchange for a commitment on spending. The agreement, Argentina’s energy minister said, could cut development costs by as much as 20 percent. A more flexible labor market, in turn, will help attract more dollars from international companies. \nOrganized labor could be the subject of further reforms after Argentine President Mauricio Macri gained a stronger hand after sweeping victories in the nation’s mid-term elections in October. “Labor and tax reforms will be at the top of the government’s legislative agenda, which aims to boost the business environment improvements that begun in December 2015,” Jimena Blanco, the head of Latin America issues at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, wrote in a research note in October. \nRead more on Oilprice.com: Oil Prices Could Double If Middle East Conflict Escalates \nAt the same time, Macri’s government has proposed cuts to natural gas subsidies. The price of natural gas in Argentina is fixed at $7.50/MMBtu, a windfall price for YPF given that spot prices in the US trade at roughly $3/MMBtu. The higher price, the government has long argued, encouraged investment and would help boost production. But it has come at a steep cost to the treasury. Read more Russia, Saudis team up to boost fracking tech \nNow, the government plans on scaling back subsidies. The fixed price will be lowered to $6/MMBtu by 2021 and subsidies for production above a certain pre-determined level will be phased out at the end of this year. YPF said that it was “disappointed” by the move, and would reallocate spending from natural gas to oil in response. “With the new gas rules, we will probably see more growth in crude oil than in natural gas vis-a-vis what we were envisioning in the plan,” YPF CFO Daniel Gonzalez said, according to Reuters. \nIn addition, YPF hopes to refocus its efforts on conventional production, which, according to the FT, fell out of favor in recent years until President Macri overhauled the company’s management. Conventional output still accounts for the lion’s share of the company’s output. \nStill, if Argentina is to become the next shale powerhouse, it will need much greater levels of capital, along with drilling expertise—things that will need to come from abroad. \n“Frankly, what we are looking for is experience from the US, experience from companies that went through the same cycle, who can bring technologies that we don’t have here,” Miguel Gutierrez, YPF chairman, told Bloomberg in an interview. YPF and the government have been courting companies like ExxonMobil, Total, Shell and Chevron for years, hoping to lure them into sinking billions into the Vaca Muerta. There are more than 15 companies exploring in the Vaca Muerta. \nRead more on Oilprice.com: Oil Survives Bearish Backlash \nExxonMobil recently won a 35-year concession for the rights to develop a shale gas block called Los Toldos I South. The oil major said it plans on investing $200 million initially for a pilot project that will consist of seven wells, production facilities and export infrastructure. “We are very optimistic about this resource and the provincial government’s approval enables us to do the necessary work to continue expanding our operations,” Sara Ortwein, president of ExxonMobil’s XTO Energy, said in a statement at the end of October. “We look forward to continuing to work with the government and our partners to develop the country’s energy resources.” Last year, Exxon said it had plans to spend $10 billion on Argentina shale over the next few decades. \nIn order for Argentina to really replicate a shale revolution, it will need oil majors to follow through on promises like those. It still remains to be seen if the oil majors are willing to put that kind of money on the line in a shale region that is still in its early stages. \nThis article was originally published on Oilprice.com",

      "text": "In 1997, Debbie and Frank Astorino welcomed three children into the world, triplets Kevin, Kerri and Sheri.\nThe Astorinos had their babies thanks to in vitro fertilization, a medical procedure that they paid for out of pocket after spending nine years trying to get pregnant using other methods.\nThe procedure cost them $10,000 to $15,000. Even worse, Debbie's doctor said her chance of achieving pregnancy was only 25 percent. That's why Debbie chose to stack the odds.\n\"This was a one-shot deal for us,\" Debbie said. \"I remember crying and begging the doctor to put in four embryos, and him refusing and insisting on putting in three. He told us four was risky for the babies and my health, but what he didn't understand was this was our only chance. We couldn't afford another cycle.\"\nThree embryos turned out to be more than enough.\nSource: Debbie Astorino The Astorino triplets were born at 30 weeks. \"I'm grateful that he didn't put in four. Because the babies did have tremendous health issues,\" Debbie said.\nThe triplets were born prematurely and had low birth weights, both common complications of multiple births. They spent eight weeks in neonatal intensive care before being sent home with 24/7 nursing care.\nTaking care of the triplets' medical needs was expensive. Frank estimates he and Debbie submitted over $1 million in medical bills after the babies were born.\n\"Insurance covered most of the aftermath but not the preplanning,\" he said.\nTwo decades later, not much has changed. IVF remains expensive and, according to a 2015 study, the odds of a successful pregnancy after one cycle of IVF stand at just 29 percent.\nFinancial incentives still affect IVF practices, leading to high rates of multiple births and hefty medical bills.\nA lack of insurance coverage Roughly 1 in 8 couples, or 12 percent of married women, have trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. This statistic has grown over the years, in large part due to the increasing age of prospective mothers. As couples wait longer to have children, more are turning to IVF for help once they're ready. Today, about 1 in 60 newborns was conceived by in vitro fertilization.\nBut even as demand for IVF rises, insurance coverage remains limited. A 2017 study by Mercer, a health-care consulting group, found that only 26 percent of companies with over 500 employees cover the procedure. The result is that many Americans are left paying fully out of pocket.\nFor Marisa and Brad Hillman of Oxford, Connecticut, four cycles of IVF ended up setting the couple back over $40,000. They took out a home equity loan and later moved in with Marisa's parents to save money.\nFinancial pressures lead to multiples Patients like the Hillmans who pay for IVF on their own often end up weighing the price of doing a single-embryo transfer multiple times or a multiple-embryo transfer once.\nThat's why, for their third cycle of IVF using frozen embryos, the Hillmans asked their doctor to implant three.\n\"We had six frozen embryos. And if we put in one at a time, that's $2,000 each time. Or we can put in three, and it's still $2,000. The number of embryos you put in doesn't change the cost.\"\nTheir doctor refused and put in two. Marisa is now pregnant with twin girls due in December.\nThe Hillmans' story is not unique.\nshow chapters Four cycles of IVF, two miscarriages and $40,000: One couple's infertility story      6:49 AM ET Mon, 20 Nov 2017 | 01:36 \"If you've saved up $10,000 or $15,000, or maybe you borrowed against a 401(k) or borrowed from friends and family, maybe you're feeling like that is your only chance, that one IVF cycle. That creates a lot of risk,\" said Barbara Collura, president of Resolve, an infertility advocacy association.\nToday, nearly 40 percent of infants born from IVF are multiples.\nMultiples are dangerous and expensive The risks to mothers carrying multiples and the infants are substantial. Dr. Dmitry Kissin of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risks to mothers include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and a higher rate of cesarean sections. The risks to infants include low birth weight, prematurity and sometimes long-term disabilities like autism and cerebral palsy.\n\"The chance of dying during pregnancy for mothers after IVF is three times higher if they carry multiples compared to mothers who carry singleton babies,\" Kissin said. \"And for children, the chance of death during the first month of life is six times higher for twins and 14 times higher for triplets.\"\nNo one knows the risks better than Debbie Astorino. \"It sounds all well and good when people see that I have triplets. But unfortunately, no one had it easy. The ride was bumpy,\" she said.\nDebbie suffered from gestational diabetes and dangerously high blood pressure. She was put on hospital bed rest after 23 weeks gestation. The triplets were born weighing 2.8 to 3.9 pounds.\nSource: Debbie Astorino The Astorino triplets spent eight weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit. Those sorts of medical complications are expensive.\n\"It turns out that paying for infertility care and controlling the number of embryos that are transferred would actually save money for the overall cost of medical care in the United States,\" said Dr. Richard Paulson, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.\n\"The problem is getting over the initial energy that has to be expended to make it happen.\"\nThere's research backing up his claim.\nAs early as 1998, Swedish researchers concluded that one-embryo transfers were more cost-effective than two embryo transfers when accounting for the costs associated with multiple gestations.\nA case for single-embryo transfers In mid-2010, Quebec's universal health insurance began covering all in vitro fertilization costs, with a caveat. The policy requires its patients to undergo single-embryo transfers.\nThe result in Quebec is that multiple births declined and the cost per live birth decreased.\nDr. Bradley Van Voorhis, director of the IVF Program at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, says U.S. insurance companies may be picking up on this trend.\n\"It's going to become a growing trend across the country as insurance companies understand that when they're covering IVF, the greatest expense they have is paying for extremely premature infants,\" he said. \"So more and more insurance companies are really demanding that single embryo transfers be done in good-prognosis patients if they're going to cover this treatment.\"\nBut others say there isn't enough data available yet to persuade employers to cover IVF from a financial standpoint.\n\"It's clear there's definitely an offset. But whether this offset is 100 percent of what the employer is spending, we just don't know,\" said David Kaplan, a senior partner in Mercer's Health business. \"It also depends greatly on the structure of the employers' benefit and many other factors.\" \nWhat's next for infertility coverage? This year, the infertility community celebrated what they say is long overdue news; infertility was officially declared a disease by the American Medical Association. Many hope this will be the catalyst that helps expand insurance coverage.\nIn the meantime, Resolve's Collura says there's a need to educate employers on the benefits of providing infertility coverage for employees.\n\"We as a field haven't done enough to equip these companies with data and information on this field, on benefit design for IVF, and on what employees really need and want,\" she said. \"When we see the financial concern removed from this medical decision, people actually make better medical decisions; they have better, healthier outcomes.\"\nProponents of increased insurance coverage say that policy would help eliminate financial concerns from a critical medical decision, potentially reducing the high rate of multiple births.\nAnd, they say, it might just end up saving patients, employers, and the entire health-care system money in the long run.\nWATCH: From zero to four kids in one year show chapters This family has four kids in college.

      "text": "The Trump administration’s dismantling of environmental regulations has intensified a growing civil rights battle over the deadly burden of pollution on minorities and low-income people.\nBlack, Latino and disadvantaged people have long been disproportionately afflicted by toxins from industrial plants, cars, hazardous housing conditions and other sources.\nEnvironmental Justice But political leaders, academics and activists spoke of a growing urgency around the struggle for environmental justice as the Trump administration peels away rules designed to protect clean air and water.\n“What we are seeing is the institutionalization of discrimination again, the thing we’ve fought for 40 years,” said Robert Bullard , an academic widely considered the father of the environmental justice movement. \n“There are people in fence-line communities who are now very worried. If the federal government doesn’t monitor and regulate, and gives the states a green light to do what they want, we are going to get more pollution, more people will get sick. There will be more deaths.”\nActivists and some in Congress now view the blight of pollution as a vast, largely overlooked civil rights issue that places an unbearable burden on people of color and low-income communities. \n'Cancer Alley' residents say industry is hurting town: 'We're collateral damage' Read more \nSenator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, recently said: “Civil rights have to include, fundamentally, the right to breathe your air, plant tomatoes in your soil. Civil rights is the right to drink your water.\n“If your children don’t have access to clean air and water, all the ideals we preach in this country are a lie. Environmental justice must be at the center of our activism in our fight to make real the promise of America.”\nWho lives near superfund sites? A superfund site is land in the US that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the EPA as a candidate for cleanup because of risks to human health, or the environment. Last month, Booker unveiled new legislation , supported by a group of senators including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, that he said would help eliminate environmental injustice. The bill would require federal agencies to address the issue, force authorities to consider existing pollution when allowing new industrial facilities and hand individuals the power rto use the Civil Rights Act to sue over pollution.\nMustafa Ali, who helped create the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) office of environmental justice and worked there for 24 years, told the Guardian he’s been alarmed by proposed EPA budget cuts and the federal government’s heavily criticized response to the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Puerto Rico, which was struck by Hurricane Maria in September.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eve Butler stands near a relative’s home that is surrounded by oil storage facilities on all sides in St James, Louisiana, which has become known as ‘cancer alley’. Photograph: Lauren Zanolli for the Guardian \n“I left the EPA because of the proposals to roll back legislation that will have direct impacts on local communities,” he said. “Ten months in, they have yet to move forward any action to help communities be healthier. People in Puerto Rico are drinking toxic water. Unfortunately, so far, I’ve been proved right in my decision to leave. I wanted them to prove me wrong.”\nThe Trump administration has targeted dozens of regulations it says have stymied economic growth. It has moved to axe an Obama-era plan to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, delayed new standards to cut toxic fumes from vehicles and dropped a proposed ban on a pesticide linked to developmental delays in children. \nAn EPA spokeswoman said the agency was “pursuing commonsense reforms that reduce regulatory burden while maintaining environmental and public health protection”. She said the agency’s leadership was “refocusing EPA on its core mission” to tackle the most significant environmental and public health problems.\nA million tons of feces and an unbearable stench: life near industrial pig farms Read more \n“Under the nation’s environmental laws, the US has made great progress in cleaning up the air, land and water,” she said. “However, we acknowledge that many low-income, minority and tribal populations still bear a disproportionate burden of potential risk from sources of pollution.” \nThe Trump administration’s proposed budget outlined a plan to close the EPA’s office of environmental justice, although this plan now appears to have been shelved with the office shifting to be directly under the purview of the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt.\n“This move is a reaffirmation of administrator Pruitt’s commitment to the mission and goals of the agency’s environmental justice program,” said the EPA spokeswoman. \nBut Ali said there was little evidence the agency is focused on vulnerable communities, claiming it is a “particular slap in the face” that the EPA wants to cut funding for anti-lead programs given that the largely black city of Flint, Michigan, continues to suffer from lead-tainted water, three years after the scandal was exposed. \nRecent high-profile controversies such as Flint, where a series of failures allowed lead to leach into the drinking supply, and the Dakota Access pipeline, where protestors in North Dakota have clashed with police over concerns the Standing Rock tribe’s water will be contaminated, have elevated the profile of environmental justice. But similar problems have dotted the US for years, often lingering stubbornly. \nI had never heard of environmental racism until I was a victim of it. It’s sickening that this is going on in America\n\nBooker recently embarked on a tour of festering environmental problems suffered largely by minorities, including a North Carolina community next to hog farms that spray untreated waste on to nearby fields , meaning that opening windows or hanging washing outdoors are risky endeavors. The industry dismisses these claims.\nBooker also visited Uniontown, Alabama, which he said had been “ruined” by a giant industrial waste dump and the so-called “ cancer alley ” – communities that live alongside an infamous corridor of petrochemical plants in Louisiana. But he said it wasn’t necessary to travel far from his home state to understand the problem. \n“I became an environmentalist, I have to be candid with you, not because of the effects of global warming some time in the future,” said Booker, a former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, at a time when the city was experiencing its own problems with lead contamination of drinking water. “I became an environmentalist because I saw horrific examples of environmental injustice and how it was hurting my community in every single way.”\nBlack communities are most exposed to solid waste facilities in North Carolina Black communities are most exposed to solid waste facilities in North Carolina Against the unusually industry-friendly approach adopted by the White House and EPA, as well as a Republican-controlled Congress, Booker’s bill has little foreseeable chance of becoming law. But it signals a fresh determination by activists to put pollution on the same civil rights footing as other issues, such as criminal justice. \n“It’s definitely moved up the priority list,” said Ali. “I wasn’t around late 1960s and 1970s, but people talk about a spirit of civic engagement then. We are seeing a new round of that now.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pollution in America. ‘If the government doesn’t monitor and regulate … more people will get sick. There will be more deaths.’ Composite: AP, Getty Images & Rex Features \nThe roots of the environmental justice movement are diffuse, but a string of events in Houston, Texas, proved foundational. In 1967, an eight-year-old black girl drowned at a landfill dumping site that was placed in a heavily African-American neighborhood. Community members picketed the site, joining forces with other protesters who were agitating against racism in the city’s schools.\nA decade later, Bullard, then a sociologist at Texas Southern University, began to study the placement of toxic sites in Houston and discovered an alarming pattern. All five city-owned landfills and six out of eight city-owned incinerators were placed in black neighborhoods, despite black people making up just a quarter of Houston’s population. Bullard said instead of Nimby politics, there was what he called Pibby (Place in blacks’ back yard). \nUS counties with the highest rates of heart attacks. Many health problems are linked to environmental pollution although a direct cause is rarely specifically identified. US counties with the highest rates of heart attacks. Many health problems are linked to environmental pollution although a direct cause is rarely specifically identified. “I was shocked and angered by what I saw in Houston,” Bullard said. “I then started to look at Dallas, at Louisiana, at West Virginia, at Alabama. Houston wasn’t atypical at all. Residential apartheid was happening everywhere.”\nYears of racist housing policies, tacitly and explicitly approved by government, and a lack of political clout made minorities close neighbors for manufacturing plants, landfills, power stations and other potentially toxic facilities. State-led pursuit of polluters, particularly in some southern states, has been tepid . \nLife on the Keystone XL route: where opponents fear the ‘black snake’ Read more \nThe environmental movement was initially slow to see its cause as being intertwined with civil rights. “We love polar bears, birds and wetlands, but we also want to talk about children being poisoned by lead,” said Dr Benjamin Chavis, a civil rights leader who was an assistant of Martin Luther King Jr. \n“We had a lot of education to do with very smart white people in the environmental movement. We had to call out their paternalism and racism. They said they don’t deal with social issues, like breathing air was a niche social issue.” \nThe issue of environmental justice, aided by the research of Bullard and many others since, is now both understood and persistent.\nOf all the people who live within three miles of the most toxic sites in the US, known as superfund areas by the EPA, 46% are minorities – a proportion far higher than the 37% national non-white population. \nUS counties with the highest rates of breast cancer. Many health problems are linked to environmental pollution although a direct cause is rarely specifically identified. US counties with the highest rates of breast cancer. Many health problems are linked to environmental pollution although a direct cause is rarely specifically identified. One in three Latinos live in areas that violate federal standards for ozone, a pollutant that causes smog and is linked to an array of health problems. The thousands of abandoned mines that dot the western US have left a legacy of soil and water contamination that blights native American tribes, such as the Navajo nation .\nNearly seven in 10 African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant, compared with 56% of whites. Once the coal is burned, its ash, which can damage the nervous system and cause cancers if ingested or inhaled, is dumped in about 1,400 sites around the US – 70% of which are situated in low-income communities. \nPollution is disproportionately afflicting African Americans, and the trend is only increasing\n\nOil and gas operations also loom over many black neighborhoods, potentially exposing them to a stew of chemicals including benzene, sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde. \n“The effects of oil and gas pollution are disproportionately afflicting African Americans, particularly cancer and respiratory issues, and the trend is only increasing,” said Dr Doris Browne, president of the National Medical Association. \n“Our membership is seeing far too many patients in communities of color suffering from these diseases. It is our goal to fight to reverse this dangerous trend.”\nMore than 1 million African Americans live within half a mile of an oil or gas facility, according to research compiled by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Clean Air Task Force. An even larger black population – around 6.7 million people – live in a US county that also features an oil refinery.\nThe NAACP maintains that “fence-line” communities near industrial plants emerge when energy companies target certain neighborhoods that then enter a gloomy spiral that forces property values and traps residents. The organization has recently expanded its campaigning to focus on how communities of color are now bearing the brunt of natural disasters, such as the recent hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, that are supercharged by climate change. \n“The main factor is race – poor whites do better than middle-class blacks,” said Bullard. “Housing discrimination is so entrenched in America that money doesn’t buy you out of segregated neighborhoods.\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People rally in front of Trump International Hotel during the Native Nations Rise protest in March.

A black person will meet discrimination, which drives who lives where and what is located there. You see this pattern all over – parks and grocery stores and so on aren’t located in black neighborhoods. But pollution is.”\nAmerica’s air is generally far more breathable and its water broadly safer to drink than the 1970s, but discrepancies remain, including among children, who are acutely susceptible to airborne particulates that cause respiratory problems and lead-laced water that can hinder development. \nMore than 14% of black children in the US have asthma , compared with 8% of white children. Black children are also much more likely than their white counterparts to be hospitalized due to the condition. \nPollution often lingers at both home and at school – about one in 11 US public schools sit within 500ft of a highway or other major road. Studies have linked heavy traffic to childhood asthma. \nFederal action began to ramp up in the early 1990s, with a small but dedicated environmental justice office opening within the EPA and the then president, Bill Clinton, penning an executive order demanding government agencies acknowledge the issue and deeming environmental racism as contrary to the Civil Rights Act.\nThe EPA has been repeatedly criticized since this point for its sluggish approach to protecting minority communities from insidious pollution, but the final year of the Obama administration saw a new plan to bolster environmental justice and beef up enforcement. These modest gains could now be snuffed out under a Trump presidency.\n‘This administration has pushed us into the gutter’ “We had to struggle under George W Bush but we weren’t pushed into the gutter – this administration has pushed us into the gutter,” said a senior EPA official who recently departed the agency. “These communities depend a lot on the EPA, they don’t have much sustainability in them. I just hope we don’t go so far back that we can’t pull it around.”\nThe prospect of a backwards step horrifies those who have already suffered from America’s pollution inequity. In 2002, Sheila Holt-Orsted noticed a cluster of cancers in her hometown of Dickson County, Tennessee, including her father and aunt. Babies were being born with deformities, such as cleft palates. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Since January, the White House, Congress and the EPA – led by Scott Pruitt – have engineered a reversal of regulations designed to protect the environment and public health. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA \nDespite being a healthy former bodybuilder who had since moved to Virginia, Holt-Orsted was worried enough to head to the doctor, who informed her she had stage two breast cancer.\n“Once I picked myself up off the floor, I felt I had to do something, so I decided to move home to find the common denominator,” she said. By digging through county and state records, Holt-Orsted found out that a landfill, located less than a mile from her family’s house, was leaking trichloroethylene (TCE), an industrial solvent that is a known carcinogen and neurological toxin, into the drinking water supply at levels far higher than EPA’s safety standards. \nNot only was the landfill placed in the heart of Dickson County’s African-American enclave, which included the Holt-Orsteds, but the remediation of the issue was also drawn along racial lines. Holt-Orsted was handed records that showed official state letters were sent to white households warning of the contamination, while black families were sent letters claiming the water was safe to drink.\n“It was ignorance, it was racism,” Holt-Orsted said. “Our community was the sacrificial lamb for this landfill.” What followed was a 10-year legal battle that finally forced the authorities to address the pollution and connect households to a clean water supply. “Even then, some of the white people in the town said we were just some niggers looking for money,” Holt-Orsted said.\nThe more recent water contamination in Flint was “sickening”, Holt-Orsted said, and she worries that further outrages will occur if regulations and enforcement is forgone in favor of industry-friendly bromides.\n“The Trump administration will have a huge affect on everyone,” she said. “It’s scary to see how much they are siding with industry. All industry thinks about is how much money to make and that’s exactly what happened in Dickson.\n“I had never heard of environmental racism until I was a victim of it. It’s sickening that this is going on in America.”\nData research by Mona Chalabi \nTopics Environmental justice in America Trump administration Race issues news",

      "text": "TOKYO -- U.S. military personnel in Okinawa have been restricted to base and banned from drinking alcohol after a Marine was arrested over a crash that killed a Japanese man.\nPolice on the southern Japanese island arrested 21-year-old Nicholas James-McLean late Sunday on suspicion of negligent driving resulting in injury or death and driving under the influence of alcohol, said Kazuhiko Miyagi of the Okinawa police.\nHe confirmed that a breath test indicated James-McLean had an alcohol level that was three times the legal limit. The Marine was slightly injured, Miyagi said.\nEx-U.S. Marine charged in Japan rape, murder case\nHidemasa Taira, 61, who was driving a small truck, died in the Sunday morning crash in Naha, the main city in Okinawa.\nHe was making a turn when his vehicle was hit by James-McLean's truck, which was coming from the opposite direction, according to Japanese media. The reports cited witnesses as saying the Japanese driver had the right of way when the crash occurred and the Marine may have driven through a red light.\nThe incident could fuel opposition to the U.S. military presence on Okinawa , where about 25,000 American troops are stationed and where local residents have expressed concerns in the past about military crime and crowding on the island.\nThe U.S. military said \"alcohol may have been a factor\" in the crash.\nBuying and drinking alcohol was banned for U.S. military personnel all over Japan. As well, those on Okinawa were restricted to base and their residences, until further notice.\nThe military said commanders across Japan will immediately lead mandatory training on responsible alcohol use and acceptable behavior.\n\"When our service members fail to live up to the high standards we set for them, it damages the bonds between bases and local communities and makes it harder for us to accomplish our mission,\" U.S. Forces, Japan, said in a statement posted on its website.",

      "text": "US service members restricted to base, alcohol prohibited after deadly crash in Okinawa More The U.S. 7th Fleet ordered that all U.S. service members on the Japanese island of Okinawa be restricted to base and to their residences and prohibited their consumption of alcohol after a deadly crash involving a U.S. Marine. A U.S. Marine whom police say had a blood-alcohol content three times the legal level was allegedly involved in an accident on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa that left a 61-year-old Japanese man dead. The unidentified Marine was driving a truck that collided with a small truck at an intersection early Sunday morning in Naha, the main city in Okinawa, police said. The 7th Fleet said its directive was \"effective immediately,\" and included residences as well as \"public locations.\" Kazuhiko Miyagi of the Okinawa police confirmed Japanese media reports that a breath test indicated the Marine had an alcohol level that was three times the legal limit, the Associated Press reported. Later Sunday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry put out a statement saying that the Marine was “ driving under the influence of alcohol” when the collision occurred. \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan, expressed its deep regret over this incident and requested that discipline would be strengthened and that measures would be taken to prevent recurrence,\" the statement said. The U.S. Marine Corps Installations Pacific said in a statement that the cause of the crash is under investigation, according to Stars and Stripes. \"I would like to convey my deepest regret and sincere condolences to the family and friends of the Okinawan man who died as a result of this accident,\" Lt. Gen. Lawrence Nicholson, commander of Marine Forces Japan and III Marine Expeditionary Force, said in the statement quoted in Stars and Stripes. \"We are still gathering facts and working with the Japanese authorities who are investigating the accident and its causes.” The fatal auto incident could rekindle growing opposition in Okinawa to the U.S. military presence there. A statement by the 7th Fleet said \"alcohol may have been a factor\" in the deadly crash. \"When our service members fail to live up to the high standards we set for them, it damages the bonds between bases and local communities and makes it harder for us to accomplish our mission,\" the statement read. Last year, the U.S. government relinquished land on its Okinawa military base back to the Japanese government. The move, considered the largest land return by the United States to Japan since 1972, came after swelling protests involving large crowds of Japanese who expressed their discontent throughout the summer after a U.S. contractor charged with raping and then strangling and stabbing a 20-year-old Japanese office worker. That same year, a U.S. Navy sailor was sentenced after being found guilty of pulling a sleeping woman he found in the hallway of his hotel into his room and raping her.

      "text": "The tax reform proposal now being developed in the US Congress confirms that Donald Trump is no populist. A populist is someone who champions the ordinary folk against the elite. This is precisely what Donald Trump did in running for the presidency. He said that he \"used to be\" part of America's \"financial elite\", though \"I hate to say it\". But, said the man who claimed to be worth $US10 billion ($13.25 billion), he had changed: \"You know the funny thing, I don't get along with rich people. I get along with the middle class and the poor people better than I get along with the rich people.\"\nAnd these were the people he would serve as president: \"Every day, I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned,\" said Trump. \"These are the forgotten men and women of our country.\" He would \"drain the swamp\" of corrupt elites and lobbyists. And overarching his appeal to the overlooked was his pitch to patriotism: \"I am going to make America great again.\"\nPlay Video Replay Video Play Video Don't Play Up Next 'Justice is done': Srebrenica survivor Play Video Don't Play Video duration 01:08",

(Thomas Peter - Pool/Getty Images) \nTwo important energy deals were proposed during U.S. President Trump’s trip to China, paving the way for Chinese energy investment in West Virginia and Alaska. The deals would increase dependence between the two nations and enhance collaboration in this key industry as the U.S. transitions into a role as an energy exporter. While the U.S. is in need of energy investment, China’s government has been encouraging energy firms to diversify abroad, in part in order to gain access to fossil fuels. The negotiations don’t come without caveats, which include both practical and political considerations. \nMore on Forbes: Why Pollution-Free Growth Now Is Vital For Asia's Health And Future \nThe deals were proposed in the form of memorandums of understanding (MOUs). MOUs were signed between China Energy Investment Corp. and West Virginia to invest $83.7 billion in shale gas, power, and chemical projects, and between Sinopec and Alaska Gasline Development Corp. to pipe liquid natural gas (LNG) from northern to southern Alaska, with investments of up to $43 billion. Smaller MOU deals were signed between Cheniere Energy and China National Petroleum Corp for the sale of LNG and between Delfin LNG and China Gas Holdings Ltd. for LNG. \nU.S. as energy exporter \nThe United States is in the process of transforming from an energy importer into an energy exporter, as the production of shale oil and gas ramps up. By the late 2020s, according to analysis from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the U.S. will become a net oil exporter, and will become a net natural gas exporter this year. Much of the energy exports will go to China, which is expected to become the largest global oil consumer by 2030, surpassing the U.S. \nThe U.S. welcomed China to import liquefied natural gas from the United States within the 100 Days Plan agreed upon in May, paving the way for the new deals under discussion. China’s rapidly growing demand for LNG in the heating of homes and businesses make it a prime export target for American firms. \nIncreased collaboration \nThe deals, if solidified, would bring additional investment into the U.S. and provide new sources of energy for China. The projects in Alaska and West Virginia are also expected to generate thousands of jobs and larger economic benefits. The Alaskan governor, Bill Walker, has struggled to find partners for construction of a natural gas pipeline, with major firms BP, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips backing out of the project. Sinopec’s proposed investment might be just the partnership Alaska is looking for. West Virginia equally welcomes China Energy Investment Corp’s proposed investment, as the decline of coal and low levels of income have left many households impoverished. \nFor China, the agreements will provide new sources of energy, as China has become heavily dependent on energy imports, purchasing from abroad around 65% of its crude oil supply and 33% of its natural gas supply. China has also been attempting to diversify its energy suppliers in order to ensure energy security, and imports from the U.S. will allow China to source from another region outside of Russia and Iran. \nMore on Forbes: The Hong Kong Startup That Wants To Power Asia With Clean Energy \nChinese investment in American fossil fuels represents a new energy relationship between China and the U.S. China has been wary of the United States’ potential interference in its energy supply, fearing that the U.S. could cut off its supply at the Malacca Strait, should political conflict arise. The U.S. Department of Commerce has attempted to allay China's fears that the U.S. would use energy to retaliate against China by promising, within the 100 Days Plan, that the U.S. would treat China just as it does any other country that lacks a free trade agreement. \nCaveats \nThe proposed deals don’t come without caveats. It has been pointed out that these agreements are nonbinding and not yet solidified. The West Virginia deal, although estimated at $83.7 billion, will span a twenty-year period. The Alaska deal has yet to incorporate financing or purchase agreements, and its history of major partners withdrawing from cooperation may bode poorly for the economics of the proposed pipeline. \nIt is also unclear whether the Chinese will be fully convinced that the United States will refrain from clamping down on energy supplies as a means of political protest. On the reverse side, political opinion against Chinese investment in the U.S. has been little addressed. Although President Trump appears to embrace Chinese participation in the American energy sector, there are those who believe that an increased Chinese presence in the U.S. could undermine the American market-based economy. \nStill, if the agreements do come to fruition, they will fill some of the needs of the two most influential nations and perhaps dampen some of the political concerns surrounding Chinese entrance into the American energy sector. \nFollow me on Twitter, at @SaraHsuChina.",

      "text": "US Students Aren’t Bad at Math—They’re Just Not Motivated \nReshetylov Serhii/Shutterstock.com \nIt’s no secret that young Americans perform poorly on math and science tests, especially compared to their peers in countries like Singapore, Korea and China, where math scores are among the highest in the world. Now, a working paper surfaces a fundamental reason for that weak performance: American students are simply not trying hard enough. \nIn the latest results of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), US students ranked roughly average among the 75 participating countries. The PISA tests, administered by the OECD every three years, assess 15-year-olds around the world on math, science and reading. Governments and policy makers point to the outcomes when making the case for education reform. Quartz \nThe study found, however, that the rankings reflect not only students’ understanding of the subjects, but also whether or not they were motivated to do well on tests. \nA team led by researchers from University of Chicago and University of California, San Diego conducted an experiment. They gave students in the US and China 25 math questions from previous tests. The US ranked 36th and China ranked 1st on the 2012 PISA math test. They told a subset of test-takers that they would get cash rewards for each question that they answered correctly. Because PISA tests are taken anonymously–unlike finals or college entrance exams–the students taking the assessments had very little stake in them. \nResults showed that American high schoolers who were given cash incentives scored significantly higher than those who didn’t. They were also more likely to get correct answers toward the end of the test. For Chinese students, the incentive didn’t make a significant difference on test scores. \nThe findings suggest that without external pressure, American students are not as motivated as Chinese students when taking tests. The fact that they increased their efforts in response to incentives, also means that the test scores do not reflect their actual ability. \nThe researchers also ran a simulation, and found that if the 15-year-olds in the US had been given the same cash bonus in 2012 when taking the assessment, America would have ranked 19th in the PISA math test instead of 36th among 65 nations. \nThe PISA tests may not be high-stakes for the students who are taking them, but if US policy makers are using the rankings to push through education reform, those 15-year-olds who are phoning it in may inadvertently be influencing the curriculum for graduating classes yet to come.

      "text": "Amanda Catanzano is the International Rescue Committee 's senior director for international programs policy and advocacy, and Nazanin Ash is the vice president of public policy and advocacy. The opinions in this article belong to the authors. \n(CNN) Since August 25, Myanmar's military has waged a brutal scorched-earth campaign against Rohingya Muslims living in the country's impoverished Rakhine state.\nThe intensity of these military operations has catalyzed one of the most rapid and massive human flows seen since Rwanda, with more than 600,000 Rohingya men, women and children fleeing to Bangladesh in just over two months. The international community anticipates the number to reach, and top, 1 million in coming weeks. These refugees are arriving in Bangladesh in a desperate condition. At the time of publication, 40,000 children require life-saving treatment for malnutrition, according to International Rescue Committee research. Reports of indiscriminate bombings, targeted killings and sexual violence all but guarantee this need will grow. Tillerson under fire for turmoil at State After fleeing for their lives, these refugees continue the struggle for survival in Bangladesh. According to an International Rescue Committee assessment, nearly three-quarters suffer from a lack of food and 95% drink contaminated water -- a recipe for a public health disaster, particularly in a country where overstretched clinics saw a tripling of patients over the past month. The international community has failed the Rohingya people in this crisis, the latest miscarriage of justice in a troubled history marred by a lack of accountability and shifting responsibility for the safety and basic rights of a persecuted population. Read More Last week, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson became the latest to visit Myanmar officials, on the heels of the ASEAN summit attended by President Donald Trump and Aung San Suu Kyi , Myanmar's de facto leader. The Rohingya crisis represents a critical test of US global leadership. While Tillerson's messages -- including stronger condemnation of abuses and the need for a credible investigation -- were an improvement on the deafening silence from the White House, the crisis will see no resolution -- much less a comprehensive or lasting peace -- until the international community addresses three critical factors: To reverse this course, first the United States must spearhead an international effort to ensure accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. There has been no accountability for the persecution and violence that the Rohingya people have faced for generations. In a rush to normalize relations and declare the success of one of Asia's newest democracies, the United States ignored accountability for Myanmar's treatment of minorities, particularly the Rohingya. Tillerson's visit to Myanmar took important but incomplete steps to address the climate of impunity -- which has emboldened the country's military. JUST WATCHED Report: Myanmar military raping Rohingya women Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nReport: Myanmar military raping Rohingya women 04:12 Tillerson was right to call for an investigation into human rights abuses, but he should define a criteria for evaluating the credibility and independence of such an investigation and propose an impartial body to lead it. He also should have focused on negotiating full and unimpeded access for humanitarian agencies to reach thousands in continuing need in Rakhine state as well as access for independent investigators to monitor the crisis. He should have made clear that unless the Myanmar government meets those minimum demands, it could soon see robust, targeted, multilateral sanctions against the military and civilian leaders -- with a clear timetable for implementation. Moreover, Tillerson did not address the everyday indignities and suffering of the Rohingya in Rakhine that predate the latest violence and, as such, would do little to reverse the disenfranchisement the Rohingya people have experienced for decades -- already highlighted by Kofi Annan's Advisory Commission on Rakhine State . The Rohingya, often referred to as the world's most persecuted population, have endured decades of marginalization inside Myanmar -- including the government's refusal to recognize them as an ethnic group and their denial of citizenship, making them the world's largest stateless group as well. Much of the Rohingya population has been forced to endure an apartheid-like existence in government-controlled camps since large-scale violence erupted in 2012, and they face restrictions on basic aspects of their lives, including marriage and movement. This is a recipe for deprivation: An International Rescue Committee assessment from late 2016, for example, revealed that Rohingya are up to 10 times more likely to contract deadly, but preventable, diseases due to the poor conditions of the camps. Second, Bangladesh has hosted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees for years while also facing its own humanitarian and development challenges. The international community has largely remained silent on how these refugees should be treated while offering minimal support to Bangladesh, an all-too-common situation for poor refugee-hosting countries worldwide. Given that refugees remain displaced for a decade on average, Bangladesh's response necessitates long-term and substantial support from the international community. Last month, international donors in Switzerland pledged $344 million to this crisis, but such promises must quickly translate into concrete commitments. The World Bank's recent indication of multiyear financing to address immediate and long-term needs is another promising development, but one that cannot become a blank check. Rehearsed condemnations mean little to persecuted Rohingya These investments should target critical policy change in Bangladesh, including expanding access for international nongovermental organizations in Cox's Bazar to meet immediate needs, registering Rohingya people as refugees and allowing them to work and attend school. Third, while poor nations continue to bear the overwhelming brunt of the world's refugee caseload, wealthy nations are simultaneously stepping back from their commitments to resettle the most vulnerable refugees. Although Tillerson notably announced an additional $47 million while visiting Myanmar this week, the crisis requires both greater aid and a more comprehensive response. There is no substitute for the powerful symbolic and life-changing nature of refugee resettlement. Over the last decade, the United States has welcomed more than 19,000 Rohingya refugees, including more than 3,000 last year. But President Donald Trump's drastic reduction of refugee admissions means only 1,000 Rohingya are expected to make their way to safety in the United States this year. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already voiced her skepticism of US commitments to help the Rohingya, noting that Trump \"has made clear how he feels about refugees.\" Increasing resettlement opportunities for the most vulnerable Rohingya not only saves lives, it will go a long way toward building trust in America's commitment to support the countries most affected by the latest crisis. The Rohingya people have suffered for far too long, both from the cruelty of Myanmar's government and the silent complicity of global actors. Now, the international community has an opportunity to right this wrong, not only by responding to the urgent humanitarian needs of Rohingya refugees but also by addressing the root causes of their brutal repression. Doing so will not only save and change the lives of 1 million Rohingya but may be the only opportunity to make real the promise of a prosperous, inclusive democracy in Myanmar. Tillerson's visit was a welcome sign of renewed US focus on this longstanding crisis, but it must serve as only the first step in a long road to peace.",

      "text": "US military's new B-21 stealth bomber has Star Trek-inspired 'invisibility cloak' The B-21 bomber being made as part of an $80 billion Northrop Grumman contract. November 20, 2017 17:41 GMT A rendering of the upcoming B-21 stealth bomber Northrop Grumman \nUS military officials are in the process of building the next generation of highly-secretive stealth bombers which will reportedly boast Star Trek-inspired cloaking technology. \nA crack team of engineers is currently designing and testing advanced methods of evading radar systems and reducing heat signatures for the B 21 bomber – also known as \"The Raider.\" \nThe long-range bomber, being developed as part of an $80 billion contract won by Northrop Grumman, is shaped like a bat and each one will cost roughly $550 million to make, according to The Times . \nThe new technology will aim to resemble the type of invisibility popularised by the Klingons in Star Trek. \nUS military officials have been quoted in national security publications as saying the technology is now needed in order to stay up-to-date with the cutting-edge combat systems coming out of Russia. \nThe bomber is now under development in a heavily-guarded facility in Los Angeles , known as Plant 42. \nDetails of the weapon systems it will have remain classified, but Grumman is advertising the new bomber on its website . It is being made to eventually replace the outdated B-52 bombers, the firm has said. \nIn a report published 10 November, the Los Angeles Times revealed Plant 42 is currently staffed by 3,000 employees – but is expected to have more than 5,000 experts by 2019. \nWhile schedules are not clearly defined, the military has said it expects the new bomber to be ready by the mid-2030s. The Times reported the US Pentagon is expecting 100 to be made. \nThe B-21 will eventually have a nuclear weapons capbility but will not carry those until two years after it becomes operational, reports suggest. There are also loose plans for autonomous flight. \nColonel Mace Carpenter, a former US combat pilot, said the Raider will be equipped with the latest in advantaged stealth technology but will still need to be manned by experts. \n\"Stealth is not about making an aircraft completely unseen but harder to see,\" he added. \nLast week, US General Robin Hand, head of the Air Force's Global Strike Command, opened up in an interview with National Defense about development of the bomber. He revealed he has been \"engaging frequently\" with Northrop Grumman to keep the project on track. \n\"It is really important that we get the B-21 on time, on cost,\" he stated. \n\"At this stage of the journey — and it is still in its infancy stage — I am thrilled. I believe we have the opportunity with the B-21 to be a benchmark acquisition program with us and Northrop. \n\"And I say that because we have been partners for the last 30 years on stealth, low observable [technologies], so we already have a track record. And we have the benefit to draw the lessons learned on what went well and didn't go so well with the B-2 and apply those to this.\" \nHe said \"a resurgent Russia made us look at some things differently and served as a wake-up call.\" \nEarlier this year, Russia revealed its very first stealth fighter jet, the Sukhoi Su-57, or what the Russian press refers to as the \"Ghost.\" Russia estimates that the model will be operation next year. \nIn recent years, China has also shown off its J-31 stealth fighter in a bid to demonstrate the progress of its high-end arms development.

      "title": "US tax cuts prove Donald Trump is nothing but a fake populist",
      "text": "'Forbidden Planet' robot sets auction ... 'Forbidden Planet' robot sets auction record \nRobby the Robot, the iconic 50âs sci-fi character, has sold at auction for a record-breaking $7.1 million More videos Trump agency authorises elephant trophy imports \nThe Trump administration is lifting a federal ban on importing body parts from African elephants shot for sport in Zimbabwe and Zambia. \nWe can now test his claims against the tax reform plans he and his party are supporting. There is no more honest reckoning of a politician's true loyalties than how he or she distributes the cash. There are now three key Republican proposals for US tax reform. The President set the agenda by writing the first set of proposals. The Republicans in both chambers of the US Congress have now each put forward their own versions. The Republicans, who dominate both chambers and hold the White House, don't want to miss this opportunity. They're racing to legislate by the end of the year. \nThe House and Senate versions differ. They will need to be reconciled and amended. But there are enough commonalities across the three plans to give a clear picture of intent. Trump's original plan was drafted to make sure that the greatest benefit went to the richest Americans. Related Articles US general would resist Donald Trump nuclear strike order \nAmerica is a a country where the richest three people have as much wealth as the poorest half of the population, according to the Institute for Policy Studies based on the Forbes rich list. That is, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos of Amazon together have estimated wealth of a quarter of a trillion US dollars, about the same as the combined the wealth of the poorest 160 million Americans. Two of those three mega-rich men, Gates and Buffett, say that the system is broken. Buffett says that it's unfair that he pays the same amount of tax as his secretary. This pair campaigns for a fairer tax system. But the Republicans have revealed themselves to hold the opposite priority. \nFor example, the three versions of Republican tax reform would either abolish or dramatically cut back the amount of inheritance tax paid by the rich. Never has so much been offered to so few - only about 5,500 American families are expected to pay this tax this year. Only estates assessed at over $5.49 million pay any inheritance tax at all, or double this amount in the event that it's the estate of a couple. Advertisement \nAll three plans would cut the amount of tax paid by high income earners. In the House version, the top marginal rate would remain as it is at 39.6 per cent. But changes to allowances and other tax provisions guarantee that the overall tax burden would fall. For instance, the plan would abolish the alternative minimum tax, as originally urged by Trump. This is a tax that makes sure that, however cleverly the rich are able to claim deductions, they still pay at least some income tax. \nThe combined effect of all the provisions in the most complete and advanced of the three, the House plan, which was last week passed by the House and now goes to the Senate, is that the richest 1 per cent get 21 per cent of the total tax cut, according to the Tax Policy Centre at the Brookings Institution. To qualify for the top 1 per cent you need an annual income of $US730,000. Having qualified, you'd get a tax cut of about $US37,000 or 2.5 per cent of income. By the year 2050, this group's share of the total benefit would have swollen to 50 per cent. The bottom one-fifth of earners would get a tax cut too - of $60 a year, equal to 0.4 per cent of their average total income. Those in the middle would have tax relief of $US840 a year, or 1.5 per cent of income. SHARE",

      "text": "Thanksgiving: The annual genocide whitewash Americans continue celebrating a holiday that whitewashes the mass killing of millions of Native Americans. by Belen Fernandez 22 Nov 2017 14:13 GMT Kindergarten students, dressed as pilgrims and Native Americans, show their parents and grandparents how to do the \"Mr Turkey Gobble\" in Danville, PA on November 20, 2008 [AP Photo/Bill Hughes] \nWhen I was a schoolchild in the United States a couple of short decades ago, I spent my time acquiring important life skills - ranging from how to fake a wrist fracture in order to obtain a purple cast, to how to craft a teepee replica out of a paper bag. \nThe latter art was perfected in accordance with the holiday of Thanksgiving, which arrived each November to great fanfare, and which, in addition to teepee replication, required my classmates and I to mass-produce turkey drawings, paper Pilgrim hats, and modified, feathered headdresses. \nThese materials were then incorporated into our reenactments of the \"original\" Thanksgiving feast: that mythologised, gastronomic encounter of 1621 between Pilgrims and Native Americans that now serves as a cornerstone of the fairytale version of US history. \nOn the surface, it may seem that there's not much to criticise about a holiday based on gratitude and eating - especially when it's accompanied by absurd spectacles like the presidential turkey pardon . \nBut a glance at the historical context of Thanksgiving reveals a thoroughly nauseating affair. President Ronald Reagan seems startled as John Hendrick, President of the National Turkey Federation, presents him with the annual live “Thanksgiving Turkey” on November 16, 1984 at the White House. [AP Photo/Scott Stewart] \nLand grabs and massacres \nFor starters, as University of Texas journalism professor Robert Jensen reminds us in a dispatch on the AlterNet website, the very term \"thanksgiving\" is saturated with disgrace. \nBy 1637, Jensen writes, Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop \"was proclaiming a thanksgiving for the successful massacre of hundreds of Pequot Indian men, women and children\" - a bloody pattern that would \"repeat itself across the continent until between 95 and 99 percent of American Indians had been exterminated\". \nThe work of historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, author of An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States, serves up plenty of additional food for thought, on why Thanksgiving perhaps shouldn't inspire too many warm-and-fuzzy feelings. Native Americans are depicted at the first Thanksgiving feast, in a scene from a 1960 educational film about the Pilgrims’ first year in America [AP] \nIn a 2015 paper on the indisputable genocide of Native Americans, Dunbar-Ortiz explained point blank that settler colonialism in general \"requires a genocidal policy\" and that \"Euro-American colonialism, an aspect of the capitalist economic globalization, had from its beginnings a genocidal tendency.\" \nAmong the many, obvious financial perks of land theft, Dunbar-Ortiz noted that the seizure of Native American trade routes also prompted acute shortages of food and other necessities, thereby \"weaken[ing] populations and forc[ing] them into dependency on the colonisers, with European manufactured goods replacing indigenous ones.\" \nSo much for bountiful harvests. \nIn his book, A People's History of the United States, late historian Howard Zinn outlined other mechanisms of capitalist dispossession. An 1814 \"treaty\" with the Creek nation, for example, functioned by \"splitting Indian from Indian, breaking up communal landholding, bribing some with land, leaving others out - introducing the competition and conniving that marked the spirit of Western capitalism.\" \nFurthermore, US \"land grabs\" of Native American territory \"laid the basis for the cotton kingdom, the slave plantations.\" \nIn short, with such a sinister past on their plate, it's no wonder US mythmakers prefer to focus on pumpkin pie and cranberry sauce. Predatory capitalism \nIn recent remarks headlined \"I am tired of being invisible to you all,\" rural development economist and indigenous rights activist Winona LaDuke summed up the logic underpinning the United States' vigorous campaign to whitewash its criminal history vis-a-vis the Native Americans: \"If you make the victim disappear, there is no crime.\" \nBut how, exactly, to go about making victims disappear when US crimes are far from said and done with, and the ramifications of genocidal policy are ongoing? \nThere are, it seems, several possible approaches. Consider the fact that, as late as the 1970s, the forced sterilisation of Native American women in the US was not uncommon. A turkey float and a pilgrim woman float move down Broadway in New York City during the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade on November 26, 1981 [AP] \nIn other, even more literal instances of physical elimination, as CNN reported earlier this month, data from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention shows that \" Native Americans are killed in police encounters at a higher rate than any other racial or ethnic group.\" \nCase in point: just a few days prior to the CNN report, a 14-year-old Native American boy was gunned down by a US law enforcement official on a reservation in the state of Wisconsin. \nLast year, meanwhile, t he Independent observed that, of 29 Native Americans killed by US police between 1 May 2014 and 31 October 2015, \"27 of those deaths received no coverage\" in the media. \nTalk about disappearing acts. \nAs it turns out, many of those killed suffered from mental illness . And indeed, one can easily argue that the prevalence of mental health conditions among Native American groups isn't enormously surprising in light of continuous antagonism by US authorities and society, often in the form of socioeconomic ostracisation and environmental destruction - not to mention food insecurity . \nIt's pretty clear, then, that a lot of people in the United States won't have much to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. But at least there's Black Friday to look forward to: the ode to gross overconsumption that directly follows the supposed day of gratitude (and that has been known to result in news headlines like \"Wal-Mart worker killed in Black Friday shopping stampede\"). \nTo be sure, the Black Friday phenomenon only befits a nation built on predatory capitalism - where material excess is rendered sacred, obscene inequality is the name of the game, and communal bonds are systematically obliterated along with any remaining potential for human symbiosis with the physical environment. \nIn the end, you don't need to gorge yourself on turkey and stuffing to see that the United States itself is positively sick. \nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy.

      "text": "Pehredaar Piya Ki: Karan Wahi requests makers not to sell stupidity in the name of content, Suyyash Rai steps in to defend his show \nPopular TV actor Karan Wahi has been climbing the ladder of success professionally. After bagging the lead role in Hate Story 4, he is currently dabbling between Entertainment Ki Raat and the upcoming reality show India’s Best Superstar, which he will be seen hosting along with Rithvik Dhanjani . But the actor was recently left with sleepless nights after his newly launched eatery Frunch Us, found itself under the scanner of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). As per the Mumbai Metro approved designs, the location in Andheri, was granted to build a metro station years ago, and the restaurant will now have to be pulled down to carry on with the plans. \nShared a source exclusively shared with indianexpress.com, “Karan and his team was informed about the decision last week. It has indeed come as a shock for all as they had put in a lot of effort in building the property. As per the BMC, the land was reserved for metro use from the year 1986 and they are not bothered that it was sold for commercial use. It’s really disturbing how the government authorities woke up after 31 years to take back the land. They don’t realise how it will majorly affect the people involved with the property. The landlord might get Karan another place but the money spent on the interiors and all are gone now.” \nFrunch Us was started as a food delivery service that catered to customers devoted to healthy eating. Delivering all around Mumbai, the eatery became quite popular for its delicacies that were also filled with nutrition. After a successful business in Juhu, Karan and his partners launched another outlet in Andheri (the one in question) last month and it soon became a hotspot for all food lovers. Sadly, now they will have to bid goodbye to the sitting area, though the kitchen will continue to function as of now. \nWe further reached out to Karan, who exclusively shared with indianexpress.com, “We are in talks with the authorities and trying to find a common ground. Thankfully they heard our concerns and have allowed us to keep the kitchen intact and the food delivery is still working normally. Just hoping that things fall in place for both the parties as I also understand that the metro line is also important.” For all the latest Entertainment News , download Indian Express App © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News ",

      "text": "When AbRam thought Amitabh Bachchan was Shah Rukh Khan’s father, see photos \nShah Rukh Khan inaugurated the 48th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa this evening. In his official welcome address, the superstar emphasised on how India’s rich history has always had a culture of storytelling and story-listening. \nThe superstar said, “We are a land of stories, fables, cultural history, religious history, mythology, and legends. Stories that have mesmerised us, stories that make us think, stories that make us believe, give us hope, and inspire our future generations for the larger potential. So tonight, it feels absolutely wonderful to be surrounded by storytellers of the world, at the birth-place of stories, that is India.” \nSRK also pointed out how filmmaking is a labour of love, and that it should spread love all over and not tear the world apart. \n“I think over the years, in the last thirty years, I have learnt one thing that films are a symbol of love, and filmmaking is about loving. And I don’t mean the love-stories I have been paddling for years. I truly believe films are made with the collaboration of hundreds of people coming together, working relentlessly for an idea they believe in, they love and want to share it with the world. This idea becomes the film that we all watch and sometimes we feel very happy watching it, sometimes we dance along with the film, at other times we get angry, disturbed or agitated, and that exactly is the magic of storytelling. The magic that has the power to touch all our senses, and in doing so, actually binding us together. The essence of storytelling is incomplete if there is no story-listener. I believe storytellers and story-listeners are, or should be like a family. There is a word in Sanskrit ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, it means bringing the world together like a family,” the 52-year-old star added. \nConcluding his welcome address the king of romance highlighted that filmmakers and film-watchers should share a familial experience where even in the face of dissent and discussion the family ends up binding together. \nHe said, “I believe no matter what your language is, no matter which country your story comes from, and no matter what your ideology is, story telling and listening should be a familial experience, which binds us all together, makes relationships stronger even in the face of dissent and discussions as it usually happens in a family, instead of tearing us apart. And with that in mind, the International Film Festival of India’s slogan for this year (the future of Indian cinema) will make that come true. Connecting the world through stories, and if I may extend it and say connecting each and every one of us through stories and films here, in Goa tonight, and all times to come.” For all the latest Entertainment News , download Indian Express App © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News",

      "text": "Ex-Mexican president Fox to PM Trudeau: Don't be 'Judas' and betray us on NAFTA More MEXICO CITY — A former Mexican president has a warning for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: Don't abandon our country in NAFTA talks like some modern-day ''Judas.'' Vicente Fox warns that would be a mistake. Fox told CTV News that it wouldn't do any good if Canada ditched Mexico in pursuit of a one-on-one trade deal with the U.S., in the misguided belief President Donald Trump would go easier on Canada. Fox made his case using a biblical metaphor — urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau not to behave like the apostle who sold out Jesus Christ. ''He might, like Judas, give us a strike and go with the United States and leave us aside,'' Fox told the network, in an interview airing Sunday night. ''I warn Trudeau, and I warn Canada, you will not make it (better without Mexico).'' The Canadian government has repeatedly said it's committed to working trilaterally to renew NAFTA as a three-country agreement. However, the Canadians have also raised eyebrows in Mexico by occasionally making more ambiguous comments: some Canadian officials have at times suggested they're open to both bilateral or trilateral deals. Trump says he could do one or the other. Former prime minister Stephen Harper, in a memo earlier this year to associates that was obtained by The Canadian Press, appeared to favour the one-on-one approach. Harper suggested Trump had few trade complaints about Canada, and he said some Americans found it mystifying that the Canadian government remains so attached to a trilateral deal with Mexico. Proponents of the three-country approach say it makes sense for several reasons: the continent has integrated supply chains for products like autos, some of the strongest defenders of trade in U.S. politics are from southern Mexican border states, and, they say, there's no guarantee anyway that Trump would go soft in a separate negotiation with Canada. In the CTV interview, Fox also did what he has done repeatedly over the last two years: Blast Trump. Using a few four-letter profanities, the former Mexican president called Trump a destroyer, pitting America against the world. Canadian officials were puzzled by the Judas comment. They pointed out that there’s been no move whatsoever to isolate Mexico. “We are committed to modernizing NAFTA as a strong trilateral agreement that is a win-win-win for all three countries,” said Alex Lawrence, a spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland. ”Prime Minister Trudeau and Mexican President Pena Nieto spoke about the strength of our relationship and our shared goals as recently as last week in Vietnam, as well as during the Prime Minister's visit to Mexico City last month.” Alexander Panetta, The Canadian Press Reblog ",

      "text": "The White House says the true cost of the opioid drug epidemic in 2015 was $504bn, or roughly half a trillion dollars.\nIn an analysis to be released on Monday, the Council of Economic Advisers says the figure is more than six times larger than the most recent estimate. The council said a 2016 private study estimated that prescription opioid overdoes, abuse and dependence in the US in 2013 cost $78.5bn. Most of that was attributed to healthcare and criminal justice spending, along with lost productivity.\nQ&A Why is there an opioid crisis in America? Show Hide \nAlmost 100 people are dying every day across America from opioid overdoses – more than car crashes and shootings combined. The majority of these fatalities reveal widespread addiction to powerful prescription painkillers. The crisis unfolded in the mid-90s when the US pharmaceutical industry began marketing legal narcotics, particularly OxyContin, to treat everyday pain. This slow-release opioid was vigorously promoted to doctors and, amid lax regulation and slick sales tactics, people were assured it was safe. But the drug was akin to luxury morphine, doled out like super aspirin, and highly addictive. What resulted was a commercial triumph and a public health tragedy. Belated efforts to rein in distribution fueled a resurgence of heroin and the emergence of a deadly, black market version of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. The crisis is so deep because it affects all races, regions and incomes\nWas this helpful? \n\nThank you for your feedback. The council said its estimate is significantly larger because the epidemic has worsened, with overdose deaths doubling in the past decade, and that some previous studies did not reflect the number of fatalities blamed on opioids, a powerful but addictive category of painkillers.\nThe council also noted that previous studies had focused exclusively on prescription opioids, while its study also factors in illicit opioids, including heroin.\n“Previous estimates of the economic cost of the opioid crisis greatly underestimate it by undervaluing the most important component of the loss – fatalities resulting from overdoses,” said the report, which the White House released on Sunday night.\nLast month at the White House, Donald Trump declared opioid abuse a national public health emergency. Trump announced an advertising campaign to combat what he said was the worst drug crisis in the nation’s history, but he did not direct any new federal funding toward the effort.\nMark Zuckerberg says extent of opioid crisis was biggest surprise of US tour Read more \nTrump’s declaration stopped short of the emergency declaration that had been sought by a federal commission the president created to study the problem. An interim report by the commission argued for an emergency declaration, saying it would free additional money and resources.\n\nBut in its final report earlier this month, the panel called only for more drug courts, more training for doctors and penalties for insurers that dodge covering addiction treatment. It did not call for new money to address the epidemic.\nMore than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, most involving a prescription painkiller or an illicit opioid like heroin.",

      "text": "BOMBastic rhetoric: Congress reminds Trump ‘no nuclear first strike without its approval’ Published time: 20 Nov, 2017 13:41 Edited time: 20 Nov, 2017 14:55 Get short URL © Bryan Smith / Global Look Press It is a good reminder to the president and to the military that no offensive nuclear strike can be conducted without approval of the peoples’ houses, Ivan Eland, US defense analyst, told RT. \nUS Air Force Gen. John Hyten, head of the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) said Saturday he would disobey any presidential order to carry out an atomic strike which he determined illegal, adding he would instead suggest other legitimate options to Donald Trump. \nSpeaking at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, Hyten said the US military is not exactly unprepared to hear the nuclear order. \n\"We're not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?\" he said. \nHyten oversees the US strategic nuclear triad, consisting of long-range bombers, land-based intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Read more General in charge of US nukes says he can defy an ‘illegal’ strike order from Trump \nRT: Why is the question of illegal strikes even being raised? Is it alarming? Can this be seen as a shift in nuclear weapons rhetoric? \nIvan Eland: This is unprecedented, I think, for a general to come out and say that he would refuse an illegal order from the president. \nRT: Do General John Hyten's remarks indicate there's little real threat now of a nuclear strike? \nIE: I think Donald Trump has used some pretty harsh rhetoric against North Korea, for example, “fire and fury” and he threatened to use nuclear weapons against the country indirectly if they threatened the US again. So the foreign policy and defense establishment here in the United States is pushing back on that. There was a former head of this command at the Congressional hearings last week who said the same thing that the military would push back if there were an illegal order to launch nuclear weapons. And then shortly after that, the current head of the Strategic Command, which deals with nuclear weapons, said the same thing. I think we are seeing these generals and former generals pushing back and saying, “Yes, the military would push back on an illegal order. Of course, the military in our country is pledged to stick up for the Constitution - not any one leader or Congress, or even the president.\" If they launch nuclear weapons with an illegal order, they could be put in jail for it. \nRT: The Senate is holding hearings on whether there should be checks on the president's power to order nuclear strikes, the first since 1976. Has Trump's war of words with North Korea spooked lawmakers? Read more N. Korea rules out negotiations with US, cites 'hostile policy' & joint exercises with Seoul \nIE: I think there is always some threat when the president uses such rhetoric. But … the rhetoric from both North Korea and the US has been really inflammatory. The US probably should turn down its rhetoric; you can’t do much about North Korea. But it doesn’t help when the president uses language like this. And I think it has alarmed not only US allies, but of course US foreign policy and the defense establishment as well. Congress held hearings last week for the first time in 40 years about the president’s authority to use nuclear weapons, and that hasn’t happened for a long time. \nRT: Could the outcome of the Senate hearings temper Trump's rhetoric? \nIE: There have been bills introduced in Congress in addition to the hearings last week that would say an offensive nuclear strike, meaning a first strike, cannot be conducted without a declaration of war by Congress. The Constitution is set up that way anyways. I think the law if passed, would reiterate this situation. I think it would probably be a useful measure, just as a reminder to the president and to the military that no offensive nuclear strike can be conducted without approval of the peoples’ houses. That is what our republic was originally set up do in the Constitution in 1787 for conventional war and the same should be done for nuclear war these days. The US Constitution is not out of date at all; it just needs to be reinforced among the military and other officials including the president.",

      "text": "TOKYO -- U.S. military personnel in Okinawa have been restricted to base and banned from drinking alcohol after a Marine was arrested over a crash that killed a Japanese man.\nPolice on the southern Japanese island arrested 21-year-old Nicholas James-McLean late Sunday on suspicion of negligent driving resulting in injury or death and driving under the influence of alcohol, said Kazuhiko Miyagi of the Okinawa police.\nHe confirmed that a breath test indicated James-McLean had an alcohol level that was three times the legal limit. The Marine was slightly injured, Miyagi said.\nEx-U.S. Marine charged in Japan rape, murder case \nHidemasa Taira, 61, who was driving a small truck, died in the Sunday morning crash in Naha, the main city in Okinawa.\nHe was making a turn when his vehicle was hit by James-McLean's truck, which was coming from the opposite direction, according to Japanese media. The reports cited witnesses as saying the Japanese driver had the right of way when the crash occurred and the Marine may have driven through a red light.\nThe incident could fuel opposition to the U.S. military presence on Okinawa , where about 25,000 American troops are stationed and where local residents have expressed concerns in the past about military crime and crowding on the island.\nThe U.S. military said \"alcohol may have been a factor\" in the crash.\nBuying and drinking alcohol was banned for U.S. military personnel all over Japan. As well, those on Okinawa were restricted to base and their residences, until further notice.\nThe military said commanders across Japan will immediately lead mandatory training on responsible alcohol use and acceptable behavior.\n\"When our service members fail to live up to the high standards we set for them, it damages the bonds between bases and local communities and makes it harder for us to accomplish our mission,\" U.S. Forces, Japan, said in a statement posted on its website.",

      "title": "Donald Trump: Marshawn Lynch Should Be Suspended for Sitting During US Anthem",
      "text": "Schaaf also talked to reporters later on Monday, calling Trump the \"bully in chief,\" via Paul Chambers of KTVU: Paul Chambers @PaulChambersTV The mayor of #Oakland speaks out against the tweet by @realDonaldTrump criticizing @raiders Marshawn Lynch. #KTVU @LibbySchaaf https://t.co/Ftm1d7PeLs Lynch has sat during the U.S. anthem throughout the 2017 campaign. However, with the Raiders playing   at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Lynch rose from the bench during the Mexican anthem.   National anthem protests have become one of Trump's biggest public crusades, with the president calling on the NFL to suspend or fire players who refuse to stand. His comments before Week 3 caused the largest protest since the movement began with Colin Kaepernick during the 2016 season. Kaepernick, who remains unsigned in large part due to his divisiveness among fans and owners, was again the subject of Trump criticism in October. \"The NFL should have suspended him for one game and he would have never done it again,\" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity . \"They could have then suspended him for two games and they could have suspended him again if he did it a third time, for the season, and you would never have had a problem.\" Lynch has declined to speak with reporters for most of the 2017 season. His reasoning behind sitting for the anthem is not publicly known. His opinion on Trump, however, was made clear last month when he wore an \"Everybody vs. Trump\" shirt before a game against the Denver Broncos . Raiders coach Jack Del Rio told reporters in August that Lynch has sat during the anthem for 11 years. Facebook Logo",

      "text": "After being snapped in China before its official release, Kanye has been flexing what may become a signature look for the “Semi-Frozen Yellow” YEEZY Boost 350 V2.\nThe first public look at the “Semi-Frozen Yellow” was before any announcements made by adidas. In early August, Kanye was papped at a Chinese airport rocking the silhouettes with a light blue t-shirt, matched with an even-lighter blue open hoodie and grey socks; a casual but standout look. The highlighter yellow is a slick color match against the pale, almost pastel blue top half.\nYe wearing the Frozen Yellow Gum Sole Samples! #YEEZYBOOST350V2 🎾 \nA post shared by YEEZYSEASON (@yeezyseason2) on Aug 9, 2017 at 10:19am PDT \n\nLater on, in the same month, Kanye was papped again at Takashi Murakami’s studio with rapper Kid Cudi. Rocking almost the exact same fit, Ye swapped out the pale blue hoodie for a lighter grey one, which gave the shoe a little more emphasis, especially with the off-black, rolled cuff jeans.\nLong time no see @kidcudi and #kanyewest. Thank you for coming to my studio. It was fire 🔥🔥🔥 \nA post shared by Takashi Murakami (@takashipom) on Aug 11, 2017 at 3:41am PDT \n\nMore recently, the Life of Pablo rapper was seen with Irv Gotti in a similar color scheme; blue/green top half and grey/off-black bottoms. Matched now with shorts instead of trousers, gray shorts and socks keep the kicks looking fresh even in the dark, as the reflector heel tab catches the flash from the picture.\nKanye wearing Semi Frozen Yellow YEEZY 350 v2's 📸 @irvgotti187 #YeezyTalkWorldwide \nA post shared by YeezyTalkWorldwide (@yeezytalkworldwide) on Nov 19, 2017 at 11:44pm PST \n\nCollectively, Kanye seems to be rocking a soft-color palate for highlighter tones kicks to stand out. The simple, relaxed look could be perfect for bringing in colors into the winter wardrobe alongside room for layering other items and accessories.\nWith adidas recently announcing upcoming colorway launches for the model, including “Bold Orange” and “Solid Grey”, this could be the quickest and most stylish fit for the Yeezy drop. What do you think about Ye’s casual look? Let us know in the comments below how you’d rock the “Semi-Frozen Yellow”.\nFor more on YEEZY and upcoming launches, keep it locked here. \nRelated Shopping Tips \n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Aberdeen have raised more than £6m towards their new stadium project American businessman Tom Crotty has invested £775,000 into Aberdeen after buying up a tranche of shares. \nThe money will contribute towards the club's proposed new stadium and training ground project at Kingsford. \nWith more than £6m raised, Aberdeen have 60% of the funding for the first phase of the construction project, should planning permission be granted. \nCrotty told Aberdeen's website: \"I'm really happy to be part of a very exciting time for the club.\" \nThe venture capitalist, who was introduced to the club by director Dave Cormack, helped to set up the US charity Grassroots Soccer with the son of former Aberdeen goalkeeper Bobby Clark. \nCrotty was captain of Notre Dame University during his student days, where Clark was head coach. 'I'm passionate about football's positive impact' \n\"I'm passionate about the positive impact that football can have on young people and the wider community,\" Crotty said. \n\"This is why my investment is directed towards enhancing the community facilities on offer as part of the club's modern and progressive development. \n\"I didn't know much about Aberdeen, but Dave and Bobby made a very compelling case for the club's plans. \n\"The club has an opportunity to co-locate its community work alongside its professional football academy and stadium to create a purpose-built complex that will enhance the experience for players, act as a real magnet for young football talent and a focal point for grass-roots community initiatives. \n\"I cannot imagine this type of facility, which will reach into all parts of society, being turned down.\" Chairman Stewart Milne says Crotty's investment is an \"endorsement\" of Aberdeen's plans \nCrotty, who attended a game at Pittodrie with Cormack, made his fortune working in the communications and software industries, leading investments in dozens of early-stage companies.- \nHe sits on the boards of numerous of private and not-for-profit organisations, as well as on the board of trustees at Notre Dame University. \nAberdeen chairman Stewart Milne added: \"It's great to see Dave's efforts in attracting US investment to the club come to fruition. \n\"A key part of his new role at the club was to help us source and secure investment from America and we're staggered by this first pledge. \n\"Tom's investment in the club is an endorsement of our vision and long-term strategy.\" Share this page",

      "text": "  Idrees Patel Xiaomi Launches Five New Products on Amazon in the US Xiaomi is the fifth largest smartphone manufacturer in the world. In China and India, it is the fourth largest and second largest smartphone manufacturer respectively. Despite that, the company’s brand is not well-known to most people in the West. It is slowly rectifying that with a staged Western European launch, by officially entering the Spain market . Now, most Xiaomi phones are available in Western Europe as the company has listed them on its Amazon Spain store. \nHowever, Xiaomi continues to have no official presence in the US when it comes to smartphones. In 2015, the company opened its online Mi Store in the country to officially sell accessories, but phones continued to be missing on the store. Although consumers can import Xiaomi phones in the US, import is not a viable proposition because of the missing LTE bands on the hardware. Therefore, consumer awareness about Xiaomi in the US is still extremely low, but the company is now slowly beginning to launch more products in the market. \nIn the US, Xiaomi has sold its products through the Mi Store. The 4K streaming Mi Box was also available at Walmart as well. The company’s Mi Band has also proven popular as an affordable fitness tracker. \nNow, five new Xiaomi products are launching on Amazon. Some of them aren’t available for purchase just yet, but will be released soon. The products are: Mi Sphere 360-degree Camera, Mi Robot builder kit, Mi Power Bank, Mi Headphones, and Mi In-Ear Pro earphones. Mi Sphere Camera Mi In-Ear Pro Mi Power Bank Pro \nTo begin with, the Mi Sphere Camera is a 360-degree camera with 23.88MP resolution. It has 3.5K video recording at either 2304 x 1152 at 60 fps or 3456 x 1728 at 30 fps. It supports up to 75 minutes of video recording. It has an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, and also has 6-axis electronic image stabilization. The product will be available for $300 on Amazon from November 24 . \nThe second product to be launched is the Mi Robot Builder Kit. It has a 3-in-1 design with 978 parts. The company says it has “ everything you need to create an amazing plane, dinosaur, or robot “. It has 3 different modes for simpler or more precise control. It is said to be easily programmed, and has a self-balancing system that “ keeps the robot on its wheels in more difficult situations or terrain “. Its self-balancing includes high-capacity batteries. It is now available for purchase on Amazon for $140 . \nIn the audio field, Xiaomi is launching Mi Headphones that are over-the-ear headphones. The company says they are “ crafted with the new graphene material to provide high-performance audio “. It also promises that “ a passive radiator provides fully immersive Hi-Fi experience and powerful bass “. The headphones will be available for $130 on Amazon from November 24 . \nXiaomi also launched a pair of earphones: the Mi In-Ear Pro. Xiaomi promises that “ their patented hybrid dynamic and balanced armature drivers offer unparalleled sound “. The earphones will be available for $25 on Amazon from November 24 . \nThe last of the products to be launched is the Xiaomi Power Bank Pro. It is a 10,000mAh USB-C power bank with high-speed charging. The company says “ it has two-way fast charging [that] intelligently adjusts up to 18W “. It is only 0.49” thick, which is impressive considering its high battery capacity. It will be available for $30 on Amazon from November 24 . \nThe increase in variety of Xiaomi products which are now available in the US is a good thing when it comes to offering choice. On the other hand, smartphone users are still waiting for the day when Xiaomi officially launches smartphones in the country. Hopefully, this day comes in sooner rather than later.",

      "text": "News Alerts Qatar Says It Has US Backing In Lingering Crisis With Saudis y. Four countries in the Saudi-led bloc severed diplomatic and transport links with Qatar in June, accusing it of backing extremist groups, a charge Doha has repeatedly denied. Saudi Arabia closed Qatar's only land border. World | © 2017 Bloomberg L.P. | Nafeesa Syeed, Bloomberg | Updated: November 20, 2017 20:06 IST Share COMMENTS The Middle East has been a key foreign policy issue for the Trump administration Qatar's foreign minister said the tiny emirate has U.S. backing to resolve the ongoing crisis with a Saudi-led alliance, but the country is also prepared should its Gulf Arab neighbors make military moves.The Trump administration is encouraging all sides to end the dispute and has offered to host talks at the Camp David presidential retreat, but only Qatar has agreed to the dialogue, Foreign Minister Mohammed Al-Thani said Friday. Four countries in the Saudi-led bloc severed diplomatic and transport links with Qatar in June, accusing it of backing extremist groups, a charge Doha has repeatedly denied. Saudi Arabia closed Qatar's only land border.Al-Thani said he will meet Secretary of State Rex Tillerson next week after having talks this week with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker and ranking member Ben Cardin as well as other congressional leaders.\"The Middle East needs to be addressed as the top priority of the foreign policy agenda of the United States,\" he told reporters in Washington on Friday. \"We see a pattern of irresponsibility and a reckless leadership in the region, which is just trying to bully countries into submission.\"The Middle East has been a key foreign policy issue for the Trump administration, with much of it centered around support for the Saudis. The White House has backed the kingdom's \"anti-corruption\" campaign that has ensnared top princes and billionaires once seen as U.S. allies, it has provided support for the Saudis in their war in Yemen and it has been muted in criticism of the crisis sparked when Lebanon's prime minister unexpectedly resigned this month while in Saudi Arabia.Meanwhile, mediation attempts by Kuwait and the U.S. have failed to settle the spat with the Saudi-led bloc and Qatar. Al-Thani accused Saudi Arabia of interfering in other countries' affairs, citing the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri as an example of the oil-rich kingdom's overreach and warning that other countries could be next.Asked about the prospect of the Saudi-led bloc taking military action, Al-Thani said though Qatar hopes that won't happen, his country is \"well-prepared\" and can count on its defense partners, including France, Turkey, the U.K. and the U.S., which has a base in Qatar.\"We have enough friends in order to stop them from taking these steps,\" but \"there is a pattern of unpredictability in their behavior so we have to keep all the options on the table for us,\" he said. On the U.S. military presence, \"if there is any aggression when it comes to Qatar, those forces will be affected,\" he added.Already, the boycott is impacting the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, Al-Thani said. Qatar's C-17 transport aircraft are the main planes ferrying logistical support to coalition partners, such as Jordan and Turkey. But because Qatari planes are barred from flying over Saudi, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, \"we have only one pathway to fly, which is via Iran,\" so that if there's an emergency the planes may have to land in the Islamic Republic, he added.

      "text": "Comment › Comment Brexit brought the EU together rather than splitting us apart \nThe one clear effect of the UK’s departure plans is to speed the integration of those remaining in Europe Pier Carlo Padoan Italian Minister of Economy and Finance Monday 20 November 2017 12:29 Click to followThe Evening Standard All friends: EU leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s premier Paolo Gentiloni have the opportunity to implement an ambitious reform agenda to boost Europe’s economy Getty Images \nWhile in London for a series of meetings with the financial community last week, I was very impressed by the breadth of the debate on Brexit . As it is the main topic of discussion at all levels, many wonder what the relationship between the UK and the EU might be once the split is completed. \nI have the utmost respect for the choice of British voters, and I am unable to make predictions on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations. \nHowever, it seems to me that the vote on Brexit has produced one obvious consequence on the European Union — the acceleration of greater integration. To understand what the framework will be in which new relations between the UK and the EU will be established, it is perhaps useful briefly to review what has happened in the past decade and what the Union’s agenda should be in the near future. \nIn 2008, Europe was hit by the harshest financial crisis in generations. Even if the origin of the shock was not in Europe, the consequences were worse here than in the US, partly because our institutions and leadership did not respond adequately and some of the negative effects were not addressed in time. At the same time, the eurozone crisis unveiled long-standing weaknesses in individual countries as well as the need to strengthen the institutional architecture of the EU. Italy is pursuing a balance between fiscal adjustment — particularly needed in high-debt countries — and support for growth, tied to structural reforms. \nThe current favourable macroeconomic environment in Europe now offers an opportunity to implement an ambitious reform agenda to overcome structural impediments. Such an agenda must include national and EU programmes for improving citizens’ living standards and making the EU a strong player in the global economy. \nFrom my perspective, common solutions are preferable to splitting up. My prescription for Italy and for Europe is based on more and better innovation, through stronger support from private and public investment, and making human capital the key to obtaining stronger and more inclusive growth. Evening Standard comment: Brexiteers’ broken promises spark a revolt \nThe ingredients for success are already available: the single market, the banking union and the capital markets union must be completed and integrated so as to exploit synergies. If we are to lift growth and improve citizens’ living standards while sharing more evenly the benefits of increased prosperity, we need a multidimensional approach. In fact, all our economies need to boost investment, private and public. To this end, both the single market must be further extended to larger-scale activity, to include innovations in digital and energy. \nBanking union is the most ambitious project to reinforce the resilience of the EU, its financial markets and banking sector. Completing banking union requires risk reduction and risk-sharing to go hand in hand. The banking union should be part of the EU’s support for the real economy as banks are better equipped to provide credit. \nThe Juncker Plan and the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI) were launched by the European Commission to help provide backing for potentially profitable investment plans too risky for the private sector. The plan is aimed at the creation of knowledge-based capital, innovation and infrastructure. More investment is the way to make the best of an ambitious structural reform agenda. We should push these reforms to boost productivity growth, with more public and private investment, supported by a strong capital market union. \nThe reforms should equip our education and training systems for a fast- moving knowledge economy — the new opportunities should be available to all. This, together with more investment in knowledge creation, would underpin an innovation union. Bananas! new Tory revolt on £40bn bill for Brexit \nPolicies addressing widening inequalities must make use of the full range of available tools, while relying on solid institutions and constructive social dialogue. The lack of decisive action to tackle inequalities has direct consequences on the well-being of citizens, increasing the resentment against the union and fuelling radical anti-EU movements and parties across Europe. Inequality can be addressed also by providing stabilisation mechanisms in labour markets. \nItaly has proposed ways to create a common unemployment insurance scheme for the EU and the eurozone. Stabilising the global economy also requires international public benefits.European public benefits include a common defence, security and migration system to make our borders safer, our society more inclusive and strengthen the EU in the dialogue with its partners. A restructured EU budget should find room for these things. Europe must fully exploit the benefit of integration, while becoming more resilient in an evolving global economy Pier Carlo Padoan \nFinally, fiscal policy, coupled with structural reforms, has a crucial role in safeguarding macroeconomic stability while addressing income inequality. There are good equitable reasons to accompany the introduction of necessary structural reforms with budget allocations that partially compensate those who are, temporarily, worse off as a result of the reforms. Reducing growth gaps and providing equality of opportunity may mean additional spending in some areas but it should not alter the overall budget. \nBesides the size of government, the composition of public spending matters. As EU integration continues, a better allocation of tasks and resources between national and EU budgets will mean public finance can promote inclusive growth. This could also help improve the EU fiscal rules by enabling national tax systems to be aligned. \nThe window of opportunity will not last for ever. Europe must fully exploit the benefits of integration, while becoming more resilient in an evolving global economy. As for the UK, it must be open to greater co-operation.",

However, the Canadians have also raised eyebrows in Mexico by occasionally making more ambiguous comments: some Canadian officials have at times suggested they're open to both bilateral or trilateral deals.\nTrump says he could do one or the other.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nFormer prime minister Stephen Harper, in a memo earlier this year to associates that was obtained by The Canadian Press, appeared to favour the one-on-one approach. Harper suggested Trump had few trade complaints about Canada, and he said some Americans found it mystifying that the Canadian government remains so attached to a trilateral deal with Mexico.\nProponents of the three-country approach say it makes sense for several reasons: the continent has integrated supply chains for products like autos, some of the strongest defenders of trade in U.S. politics are from southern Mexican border states, and, they say, there's no guarantee anyway that Trump would go soft in a separate negotiation with Canada.\nIn the CTV interview, Fox also did what he has done repeatedly over the last two years: Blast Trump. Using a few four-letter profanities, the former Mexican president called Trump a destroyer, pitting America against the world.\nCanadian officials were puzzled by the Judas comment. They pointed out that there's been no move whatsoever to isolate Mexico.\n\"We are committed to modernizing NAFTA as a strong trilateral agreement that is a win-win-win for all three countries,\" said Alex Lawrence, a spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland.\n\"Prime Minister Trudeau and Mexican President Pena Nieto spoke about the strength of our relationship and our shared goals as recently as last week in Vietnam, as well as during the Prime Minister's visit to Mexico City last month.\"\nStory continues below advertisement",

      "text": "Home Op-Edge With 50,000 Yemeni children dead in 2017, UK-US-Saudi war enters horrific new stage Dan Glazebrook is a freelance political writer who has written for RT, Counterpunch, Z magazine, the Morning Star, the Guardian, the New Statesman, the Independent and Middle East Eye, amongst others. His first book “Divide and Ruin: The West’s Imperial Strategy in an Age of Crisis” was published by Liberation Media in October 2013. It featured a collection of articles written from 2009 onwards examining the links between economic collapse, the rise of the BRICS, war on Libya and Syria and 'austerity'. He is currently researching a book on US-British use of sectarian death squads against independent states and movements from Northern Ireland and Central America in the 1970s and 80s to the Middle East and Africa today. Published time: 20 Nov, 2017 12:22 Get short URL © Khaled Abdullah / Reuters Two-and-a-half years of a lethal blockade and bombardment have produced almost nothing regarding territorial gains in the West’s Saudi-executed war against the Yemeni nation. The tightening of the blockade is an obscene, desperate attempt to put off its inevitable defeat. \nThe war against Yemen, sponsored by the West and executed by their ever-loyal Saudi fall guys, is going badly. Very badly. \nWhen the Saudis began their bombardment of the Arab world’s poorest country, named ‘Decisive Storm,' in March 2015, they promised a ‘limited’ mission. In reality, it has proved to be seemingly limitless and completely indecisive. A Harvard study estimates the Saudis are spending $200 million per day on this war, driving their military budget up to $63,7 billion , the fourth highest in the world. But they remain nowhere near achieving their stated goal of defeating the Houthi-led resistance and recapturing the capital, Sanaa. Indeed, Hadi, the ‘President’ the Saudis are supposedly supporting, is still holed up in Riyadh , apparently unable to set foot in his own country, such shows the depth of popular animosity toward him. \nMeanwhile, the ‘coalition’ which Saudi Arabia purports to lead is falling apart. Qatar, the world’s richest country in terms of per capita income, who was supposed to bankroll a large chunk of the war - pulled out long ago; while the Pakistani parliament, whose allotted role was to provide the ground troops, unanimously vetoed the proposal last year. Meanwhile, in the south, the Emiratis are backing forces hostile to the very president the war purports to be defending. Read more US lawmakers slam ‘unauthorized’ military aid for Saudi-led coalition in Yemen \nIndeed, Hadi’s own troops are now complaining that the Saudis and Emiratis are actually bombing them . Yes, the ‘legitimate government’ of President Hadi, the one the whole operation is supposedly being fought in support of, is now itself being targeted by the aggressors, with Hadi accusing the Emirati crown prince of acting like an occupier . Tawakkol Karman, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning activist, even suggested that “the Saudi-led air strikes have killed more fighters of the national army than Houthis.” \nFurthermore, the war has massively expanded Al-Qaeda’s base in the country and provided a new one for ISIS. While this is not an immediate problem for Saudi Arabia in itself - after all, the more sectarian forces come to the fore, the less likely Yemen will be able to unite and pose a threat to Al Saud - but is nevertheless a real potential danger for the future, should those forces decide to turn their experience and weaponry on the kingdom itself. The Saudis seem to be, belatedly, recognizing this, recently branding as ‘Al-Qaeda terrorists’ one of the biggest Salafi groups in the country, the Abu Abbas brigade - after years of arming its men. \nIndeed, the war is going so badly that even the Saudis themselves are now privately saying they want out. Leaked emails last August revealed that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - who as defense minister was responsible for initiating the war in March 2015 - is keen to end the war. Yet still, the war continues. London-based Yemeni Safa al-Shami told me that “the Saudis are in trouble; they don’t want [the war] to continue anymore. But they are being told ‘you have to finish the mission to the end.'” By this analysis, far from ‘turning a blind eye’ to a ‘Saudi war,' the West is positively demanding that a reluctant Saudi Arabia continues its futile and murderous campaign. Our interventionism in the Middle East has not made the United States or the world any safer. Instead of calling for regime change, we need a foreign policy of restraint and diplomacy. — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) November 13, 2017 \nAnd this campaign, already characterized by a brutally callous attitude to the Yemeni population, has just reached a new level of terror. Humiliated by the firing of a Houthi missile into Riyadh on November 4th - demonstrating that, despite years of pummeling, the Houthis are now stronger than ever, the Saudis announced their blockade would henceforth become total, with entry of all goods to the country - via land, sea or air – completely stopped. \nMedecins sans Frontieres verified the following week that all of its humanitarian flights into the country had been blocked. The Saudis then announced that some of the minor ports would be reopened, but only those in government-held areas. The country’s biggest port, Hodeidah, a vital hub for imports, remains closed. And this week, the Saudis bombed the capital’s airport again, preventing aid delivery. \nEven in its previous, partial, form, the blockade’s results have been truly sickening. Hodeida's capacity has been massively crippled since its four cranes were destroyed by coalition airstrikes in 2015 , and the ‘coalition’ has prevented replacements being installed ever since. In addition, ships have been delayed, often for months, or turned back all together for no explicable reason other than to punish the population of the Houthi-controlled areas. This siege against a country dependent on imports for over 80 percent of its food, fuel, and medicine is nothing less than genocidal. \nSave the Children reported that 130 Yemeni children are now dying every day from extreme hunger or disease, with 50,000 dead this year alone. Meanwhile, the cholera epidemic, triggered by a combination of the war’s crippling of water sanitation systems and the Hadi government’s decision to block payments to all waste, sewage and health workers in Houthi-controlled areas - became the biggest in recorded history last month, with almost 900,000 infected by the disease. The previous biggest epidemic, still underway in Haiti, took seven years to reach 800,000 cases. Yemen surpassed that number in just six months. Read more ‘Few months left before they starve’: Oxfam adviser tells RT famine is ‘the real enemy’ in Yemen \nYet, with two-thirds of the population - over 18 million people - now dependent on humanitarian aid for their survival, even these shocking figures are set to escalate very quickly. Seven million people are at immediate risk of famine. If this new total ban on humanitarian aid to the country’s biggest air and seaports is maintained , they will die. These are the depths to which the West is prepared to push Saudi Arabia in its futile drive to permanently destroy the ‘Yemeni threat.' \nThe UN’s humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, has been very clear. \"I have told the [UN Security] Council that unless those measures are lifted... there will be a famine in Yemen. It will not be like the famine that we saw in South Sudan earlier in the year, where tens of thousands of people were affected. It will not be like the famine which cost 250,000 people their lives in Somalia in 2011. It will be the largest famine the world has seen in many decades, with millions of victims.” And this famine will have been consciously and deliberately executed by those responsible for this war - the Saudis, with the British and Americans behind them. \nBritain and the USA are driving the Saudis to unleash the world’s biggest famine for years against a totally captive population. Yet, as far as Western media is concerned, this is all totally un-newsworthy. The willful starvation of 130 children per day for the whole of this year is a footnote, at best, to this week’s rumors about Brexit or Trump’s latest absurd vulgarity. When I met Safa Al-Shami, she asked me, “Where is the media in all of this? How many pictures have we seen from Syria, from Iraq; where is Yemen in all of that? The media should start talking about this!” \nBut she was also clear that this lack of coverage is no excuse for a lack of action, at least not in Britain. “Look at how the British people marched and demonstrated because Tony Blair declared war against Iraq. The British people need to realize that this war in Yemen is part of the same dirty game. They have to do something. I blame the British people because they are educated and they know. The Americans are ignorant.” \nThe horrors inflicted on Yemen by the British have deep historical precedents - it was 50 years ago this month that British forces finally withdrew from Aden, the Yemeni port they had colonized in 1839. Indeed, the country is embedded enough in the national consciousness to be the subject of a new BBC drama , whitewashing and glorifying the British colonization of Yemen just as they whitewash the British role there today. \nAnd yet the British still like to think of Boris Johnson as some kind of affable buffoon. The truth is, he and the entire UK cabinet are complicit with child murderers. They, along with all those parliamentarians who voted to continue this vicious war, must be stopped, held to account and brought to justice.

Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images California is going to be the first state in the US to teach primary school students with LGBT -inclusive textbooks. The California State Board of Education approved ten textbooks that include the historical contributions of LGBT Americans for students in kindergarten through eighth grade. The bill was written by former State Senator Mark Leno and, according to the Advocate news site, “ requires history and social sciences curriculum to teach about the accomplishments of queer people and people with disabilities.” Anti-LGBT lawmaker resigns after being 'caught having sex with man' \nAdvocacy groups have applauded the board’s decision and Equality California's executive director Rick Zbur said it was a “long-fought victory”. \nAmong the seven approved publishers are McGraw Hill, National Geographic Learning, and Pearson Scott Foresman, and Prentice Hall. \nThe board also rejected two books that do not include LGBT history because the lessons did not comply with the state’s Fair Education Act of 2011. Donald Trump will be the first president to speak at anti-LGBT summit \nThe books were published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and “were rejected because they failed to address the sexual orientations of historical figures who were LGBT, or widely speculated by historians to have been LGBT,” according to the LA Times. Such figures include Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and President James Buchanan.

      "text": "What our ancient Indian culture teaches us about having a successful marriage Life together, over the years, brings about a shared evolution. 13735 --- Total Shares \nThe other day, I was lucky enough to observe an elderly couple taking a stroll along the river in Princeton (US), their steps totally in sync. You could see they had been together a long time. They hardly spoke, communicating their togetherness in more subtle ways. Eventually they reached a park bench overlooking the river, pulled out a flask of tea and some sandwiches, and together enjoyed their little feast in perfect silence. \nTheir movements were so in tune, it seemed for a moment like one person was moving. The way she poured the tea was full of gentleness and care, as was the way he received the cup. They ate their sandwiches and enjoyed the stillness of the riverside. \nThey had reached a stage in their marriage of purity in connection and communion. Did this happen as a result of a life full of perfect harmony and ease? I doubt it. Did they have arguments about how to discipline their children, and how much money was spent last month? Probably. Most couples evolve to this stage in their relationship by going through struggles and difficulties, by sacrificing their personal wishes, and by raising children, grandchildren and sometimes great grandchildren. \nThe halcyon days \nThis is the other end of the spectrum from the heady days of the young love of newly-weds, when a couple is much more physical and verbal in their demonstration of love. That is, if there is love in the relationship. We will get to that later. \nSo which one is better - the exciting early days of romance, or the halcyon days of an elderly couple? This seems like a silly question, given that it is obvious they are different stages in the evolution of a marriage , both relevant and both important. It would be a silly question, except for the fact that today most marriages in the West, and an increasing number in the East, do not last the distance. \nWhy so many divorces \nIt is worth examining why. What comes between the beginning and the end? Why is it that in today's world so many marriages end in divorce ? Is it because marriage is an outdated institution? I would say \"no\", it is because we do not understand the purpose and stages of marriages, and the nature of love. \nIt is easy to see how problems happen. The daily grind of modern life is not kind to relationships. Often both parents work long hours in order to save enough money to pay for their children's education and buy a house, and city dwellers are bombarded by all sorts of environmental pollution and stress. So by the end of a hectic day, there is little energy left to take care of each other and be kind. \nBut do you think this is any harder than living with war, famine, plagues or slavery - all situations that existed for our ancestors? We can easily blame circumstances for the failing marriages of today, but in many ways human beings have never had it easier. \nIt is also that after the joyous whirlwind of a wedding, there comes the reality of living together, accepting each other's imperfections and learning how to adjust to the new dynamics of a relationship. When two imperfect beings come together, there is bound to be some friction and adjustment. And if the couple lives with extended family, there are even more components in the new dynamics. \nAn evolutionary process \nIt is often not at the beginning or the end that marriages falter, but midway, when the struggles are the greatest. So what makes the difference between a couple that is able to stay with the evolutionary process of marriage and one that does not? \nAs more and more youngsters look for answers to such questions, where reason and emotions converge, where tradition and contemporary thinking meet, and perhaps, where science and spirituality meet, there is a need for a very relevant and practical approach to relationships that also encompasses the wisdom of the ages. \nSome ancient wisdom \nIn Yogic philosophy, we learn about the three human types: sattvik, rajasic and tamasic. We are all a mixture of the three, but generally one predominates in our make up, and this can change as we evolve. \nTamasic behaviour is characterised by ignorance and inertia. A tamasic person is often lethargic, prone to violence, and mistrust. Rajasic behaviour is characterised by action and passion. A rajasic person is one who is often focused on satisfying his own personal desires, gain and prosperity. Sattvik behaviour is characterised by purity and wisdom. A sattvik person cheerfully serves others without any expectation of personal benefit. \nThese three qualities pervade everything we do - the way we walk, talk and eat, and even the way we breathe. What happens to our breath when we experience intense anger? The nostrils flare and our breath is long, loud and chaotic; tamasic in nature. On the other hand, when we are in the state of samadhi or deep meditation, our breathing is so quiet and calm that we hardly notice it. It flows so naturally and so effortlessly, which is sattvik in nature. These qualities play out in all our interactions with others, and are very evident in our closest relationships. As a result, marriages are also associated with one of these three types. \nA tamasic marriage is based on individual gain. The couple is coming together for benefit. For example, the groom might be focused solely on the financial status of the bride's family, or gaining a trophy wife. Alternatively, the bride might be marrying someone much older for money, status or access to an easy visa. Such marriages are transactional in nature, based on narcissistic or self-centered behaviour, and can easily result in mutual distrust and discord. A spouse is a commodity to provide status, pleasure or service. \nToday, many marriages are rajasic, based on mutual love and respect, and also mutual desire and benefit. But though there may be mutual respect, the love is not totally pure and unconditional, as there is expectation. \nSo when the other person is flawed and imperfect, as we all are, there is disappointment and trouble in paradise. \nA sattvik relationship is one in which the two partners don't think of themselves as individuals, but as one. They cheerfully sacrifice everything for the relationship and each other. There is a wonderful short story by O Henry called \"The Gift of the Magi\" about such a young couple. In a sattvik marriage there is purity of intent, and no concern about physical deficiencies or financial status. Communion, mutual growth and unconditional love are at the core of the marriage. In sattvik marriages, the best emerges over a period of time, as the family is based on giving and love, and so it is strong. \nWhen children come along in a marriage, the focus of the couple shifts from attention on each other to a partnership where the main focus of attention is now on the children. The different personality types will respond in different ways to such a shift. What do you imagine will happen to a person who is self focused, who wants his or her spouse to constantly shower attention? And what will happen to a person who is always happy to give and does not need to be the centre of attention? \nHere is an example of different responses leading to different results. \nMe versus We \nYou can consider many other scenarios - financial hardship, ill health, problems with children, death in the family, worries at work, etc. How will each personality type respond when such struggles come in a marriage? \nThere always needs to be at least one giver for a marriage to work, and if there are two it can thrive. So in today's world, where narcissism and self-interest are encouraged and promoted by advertising and the media, it is not surprising that so many marriages fail or exist in suffering rather than joy. When we are intent on blaming and criticising the other person for problems, rather than looking at ourselves and accepting difficulties, nothing can move forward. We have built a \"me\" rather than a \"we\" culture. \nBut this is exactly why the institution of marriage brings so much hope for the future. Let's go back to our elderly couple in Princeton. Did they start out married life in this sattvik state together? Not necessarily. Life together, over the years, brings about a shared evolution. The rough edges are made smooth, acceptance blossoms over time, and both learn from each other how to be in harmony and stillness. That is, as long as they are both willing to stay together through all the ups and downs of married life. \nCommit to the journey \nMarriage and family life teach us to become more and more giving, if we are willing to commit to the journey. There is a traditional French tale, Beauty and the Beast , in which the beast starts out very tamasic, imprisons the beautiful Belle and locks her away as a prize. But over time the kindness, love and acceptance of Belle transforms him into a handsome, gentle prince. We love these folk tales for the very reason that they kindle something in our unconscious mind that we know is possible. \nThis is the possibility marriage brings to all of us - the opportunity to grow, refine ourselves and learn to love. Through marriage we can evolve into that sattvik state of communion I saw that day in the elderly couple by the river - so subtle, gentle and full of naturalness. I hope that more of us will have the opportunity to experience such a state. \nThat is why in 21st century yoga, family life is venerated far more than the celibate life of a monk. It is through the love and sacrifice, the struggles and acceptance, and the willingness to grow that marriage offers that we refine ourselves enough to realise our fullest potential as human beings. #The Gift of the Magi , #Couple , #Newly-wed , #Divorce The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

      "text": "Deepika Padukone's ethnic look is not making us green with envy; here's why \nDeepika Padukone just wore a stunning saree, but paired it with a blouse that failed to impress. IndiaToday.in | Written by Shreya Goswami Picture courtesy: Instagram/shaleenanathani \nThere's a lot we all love Deepika Padukone for, and her fashion sense is just one of them. The Padmavati actress is always dressed to the T, whether it's on the red carpet at Indian or international events, on magazine covers or promotional appearances. \nFrom fusion to athleisure, this B-town biggie has tried it all and stunned us with her on-point dressing sense. But, once in a while, Deepika's ensembles go slightly awry due to an element that doesn't impress. And that's just what happened with this ethnic attire she donned during the promotions of her upcoming, controversial movie, Padmavati. Picture courtesy: Instagram/afashionistadiaries \nAlso Read: Let Deepika Padukone show you how to look hot beyond words in a saree \nDeepika's choice of that elegant, pine-green Benarasi saree is just perfect. The body has large bootis in gold, which are classy despite their size. The simple, gold pallu , and the detailed embroidery on the border of the saree are outstanding. \nOne just has to admire the fact that a saree this pretty was picked out for Deepika by her friend, stylist Shaleena Nathani. Just the offbeat colour of the saree can start a fashion frenzy, for sure. Picture courtesy: Instagram/shaleenanathani \nBut what's up with the choice of blouse? The shamrock-green blouse was neither a good match nor a great contrast to the saree's unique colour. \nBy itself, the blouse is quite pretty. The boat-neck adds a contemporary feel, and the puffed, long sleeves suit the weather. The gold bootis on the blouse stand out just as much as the detailed embroidery on the cuffs. \nAlso Read: Deepika Padukone just wore the tackiest Banarasi saree ever \nAdd that blouse to that saree, however, and it's a bit too much. The unmatched colours and the incongruity of the blouse sleeves with the drape of the saree leave this attire unimpressive. A simple gold blouse would have been a more appealing match with the saree. Picture courtesy: Instagram/danielbauermakeupandhair \nDeepika's accessories add to the OTT look. When the saree and blouse have so much detail, a large, chunky choker and drop-down earrings are not a good idea. The jewellery definitely goes well with the theme of Deepika's upcoming movie, Padmavati, but not with the saree. \nOverall, Deepika's look was just confusing. The components of the ensemble are outstanding, individually. But bring them all together like this, and we're anything but green with envy.

      "title": "US Marines F-35 squadron training for nuclear war with North Korea - Business Insider",
      "text": "print \nAn F-35B Lightning II Cpl. Carlos Jimenez The US Marines' F-35 squadron in Japan is training to fight under hazardous conditions created by chemical, biological, or nuclear attacks. The Marines wear the highest-grade protective suits to train realistic battle maneuvers. The US Air Force has also been training to take out North Korean nuclear sites. \nAs part of the \"all options on the table\" approach to North Korea often pushed by President Donald Trump and his cabinet, the US has been training the first operational Marine Corps F-35 squadron to fight through nuclear war if needed. \nIn mid-November, US Marine Corps pilots and support crew donned Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) gear to train for war fighting under the strain of chemical, biological, or radiological hazards. \nThe Marines wore MOPP gear level four, the highest grade of protective gear available to the US military, while executing a \"hot refueling,\" or a fast-paced exercise where the pilot keeps the F-35's engines on while it takes on more gas, so it can take off in a moment's notice. \nHot refueling, as well as hot reloading, where F-35s take in more ordnance while the engines stay on, both represent tactics devised specifically with fighting in the Pacific in mind. \nIn the event of war with North Korea, Pyongyang's opening salvo would likely include nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon attacks via ballistic missiles on US bases in Japan. Although the US maintains missile defenses, it's not safe to assume the bases would make it out unscathed. \nFor that reason, the Marines' F-35B, which can take off and land vertically, needs flexibility to improvise, land on makeshift runways, and turn around to keep fighting in minimal time. \nTraining in MOPP gear assures that the pilots and crew won't be caught off guard when the atmosphere becomes hazardous with chemical, radioactive, or biological agents. \n\"It's important to practice in MOPP gear because the Marines do'’t get many opportunities to wear this on a daily basis, so in the instance where they do have to wear MOPP gear in a real-life scenario, it's not going to be a shock or surprise to them of how they are going to operate,\" Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Martin Aldrete, a maintenance controller with VMFA-121, said in a statement . The military's best planes and pilots are all training to take out North Korea \nLockheed Martin \nBut the Marines' F-35 squadrons aren't alone in training for a possible confrontation with North Korea. In October, 2016 Vermont Air National Guard pilot Adam L. Alpert detailed his experience flying a simulated F-35 strike mission against targets in North Korea. \nAlpert said that instead of sending 60 to 75 servicemembers into the air above North Korea aboard F-16s, F-15s, logistics, and surveillance planes, US Air Force planners managed to work out a mission where just four pilots in two F-22 Raptors and two F-35s take out North Korea's main nuclear infrastructure and leave unscathed . \nAdditionally, a citizen in Missouri intercepted US Air Force B-2 Spirit bombers communicating over radio and discussing a training mission where they were attacking targets in North Korea . \nWhile the US tries to steer clear of war with diplomatic solutions to the North Korean crisis, widespread US military movements and planning show that US is preparing for the worst.",

      "text": "Pinterest Think back to Alessandro Michele’s first women’s collection for Gucci in February 2015. It not only changed the course of 2010s fashion, but also defined how an entire generation wants to look. The unequivocal “trophy” we all wanted was a pair of the backless loafers lined with kangaroo fur, which were wonderfully weird, ultra-comfortable, and, thanks to the fluff, super warm, too. In fact, three and a half years later, those furry shoes are still flying off the shelves—which makes Gucci’s recent decision to go fur-free that much more surprising. Gucci’s had success with many of its fur pieces, actually; those loafers now come in plush lamb , and its cotton candy fox-fur chubby has become a street style mainstay. Ditto the long mink intarsia’d with serpents . Despite the five-figure price tags on those coats, they seemed like an essential component of Michele’s heavily layered rainbow-tinted collections. So why the decision to drop fur completely? The best person to ask is PJ Smith, the senior manager of fashion policy at the Humane Society of the United States, who convinced Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri to do it. “Being socially responsible is one of Gucci’s core values, and we will continue to strive to do better for the environment and animals,” Bizzarri said in a release . “With the help of HSUS and LAV, Gucci is excited to take this next step and hopes it will help inspire innovation and raise awareness, changing the luxury fashion industry for the better.” (Gucci also plans to host an auction of their remaining fur items, with proceeds benefitting the Humane Society and LAV.) We gave Smith a call in Los Angeles to ask how it all went down—and how the announcement has already created a ripple effect throughout the industry. Here, we pulled the highlights from our long conversation, including a few designers you might see following in Gucci’s footsteps in 2018. Gucci’s decision to go fur-free was five years in the making and represents a major turning point for cruelty-free, sustainable fashion. “When I started at the Humane Society in 2009, a big part of my job was just trying to get meetings with companies to talk about the risks of fur. We’d go in there and tell companies what we’re seeing in relation to animal welfare, look at what they’re selling, and identify some of the risks, then figure out how to move away from them. But something happened three years ago when I sat down with a company I work closely with, Inditex [the parent company of Zara], and they said, ‘We think what’s happening in other industries, like the food industry, will be really big in fashion.’ [At the time] we were seeing companies like Wal-Mart and McDonald’s getting out of the most egregious [animal-cruelty] processes, like gestation crates and battery cages for hens. We saw the Ringling Circus close after 150 years because people just didn’t want to see elephants doing tricks like that anymore. All of these different industries work together—it’s people changing their ideas of how we relate to animals. In the past few years, countries have started to ban fur imports, and cities like Berkeley, California, have made it illegal to sell fur. With Gucci, it took about five years of sitting down and going species-by-species to identify the risks. “From what I know about [Gucci’s decision], it really came down to the fact that Alessandro and Marco just don’t think fur is modern anymore. Gucci has this shadow committee of millennials [who weigh in on changes], and they found that young people want to support companies that are socially responsible. Millennials aren’t buying fur anymore, at least not the way our grandparents did. So I think Gucci identified that shift and knew they needed to [make a change] that would resonate with those shoppers.” The belief that real fur is more luxurious than faux fur is outdated and often just incorrect. “I think there’s this idea [in the luxury market] that you have to sell fur to be considered ‘luxury.’ From my point of view, that’s ridiculous, because I know how much faux fur is. It can be quite expensive, whereas real fur trim on a jacket can be really cheap, even just dollars. Gucci will change that misconception about luxury, though. I don’t think Gucci has even announced that it’s definitely going to use faux fur—Alessandro just said he’s excited for the opportunity to be creative on a whole new level, which doesn’t necessarily mean faux fur. But I don’t think it’s ever been like this before, where companies are seeing there is a huge demand for it. There are [new faux fur brands like] House of Fluff , and what Chloé Mendel is doing using real fur machines to make faux fur coats, that’s awesome. We recently met with Diane von Furstenberg and saw her brand-new faux fur jackets , and I had to check the label to make sure they were faux—that’s how good they felt. And I just saw someone at our HSUS gala wearing Burberry ’s new faux fur coat, and it was just amazing.” A fox fur coat from Gucci’s Fall 2016 show. Photo: Indigital.tv Pinterest On the other hand, lab-grown fur (and leather) is also a real possibility in the future. “Faux fur is getting better and better, but I’ve also been learning about alternative fabrics in fashion. There’s a company that’s growing fur from stem cells—I had no idea it was possible. You see this in food, too. There’s clean meat, which is grown in a lab, and that’s hitting the market soon. I think it freaks people out a little bit, but there are meat alternatives [like seitan] that are getting better, too. So that will happen in fashion as well—it’s twofold. We’re telling companies about faux fur and faux leather, but there are also these new supply chains that make silk without the worms, or fur without the mink, or leather without the cow. That lab-grown fur and leather might be expensive, but if you’re Hermès, you’re going to be first in line to get it, because you have the price point.” Gucci’s fur-free announcement has ignited a debate over the environmental impact of faux fur, but it’s a complex issue. “Since Gucci happened, the fur industry’s main response has been attacking faux fur as not being environmentally sound. The idea that one is less environmentally conscious than the other . . . It’s a talking point that distracts from the real problems the fur industry is facing. When you have any product you’re going to mass produce [like faux fur coats], it will have an environmental impact. One supply chain has extreme cruelty attached to it, and fur does have an impact on the environment. Thousands of animals are living on a single fur farm, where urine and feces go into the waterways and into the ground. And you have trapping in North America, where leg-hole traps will hold an animal for days or weeks, and they can trap an endangered species or people’s pets [by mistake]. It’s also an industry involved with tanneries, which have this toxic soup of formaldehyde and chromium that gets released into the environment. Comparing that to faux fur, I think it becomes obvious which one is most hazardous to the earth.” Going fur-free is just step number one for companies that want to be more sustainable. “Starting with a fur-free policy gives companies a platform to get out of the most controversial, egregious practice in fashion. Then they can build on it from there. We work with companies on all supply chains, like transparency and making sure the standards are as high as possible. I can tell you it’s really difficult, even for things like wool and down. There are a lot of organizations and companies that are trying to trace them, and it could be [as distant as] a hut in Malaysia. Trying to implement standards at that level, it becomes really difficult. That’s why LVMH is buying up their supply chains, instead of trying to make the current system better. “For all policies we work on, innovation has to be a big part of it. I think we’ve done a really good job of reinventing this question of, ‘What is luxury?’ Previously, it was tradition. Now, [the definition] is moving towards innovation and sustainability. I get emails weekly from companies who say, ‘We just got 25,000 water buffalo horn buttons,’ or ‘What are your thoughts on yak fur?’ The Humane Society has experts around the world who I can reach out to for information on those supply chains, so I can go back to those companies and lay out the risks.” You can expect to see many more designers and companies going fur-free in 2018. “Since Gucci’s [announcement], my phone has been ringing off the hook. So many companies now want to be the next Gucci. I think it took a huge, unexpected name like that to make a difference. It will be interesting how this trickles down throughout out the rest of Kering [Gucci’s parent company], or if LVMH will have an answer to this, since they don’t have an equivalent to Stella McCartney or now Gucci. And we’ve worked with Burberry for several years, but now that it’s getting a new creative director, I’m curious what will happen there. “On a more mass level, Burlington Coat Factory is going fur-free , and that really shows what’s happened in the last 15 years. Burlington was one of the first companies the Humane Society found selling dog fur in the ’90s, and because of that, we were able to pass the Dog and Cat Protection Act, which banned imports of dog and cat fur. Fast-forward six years, and we started to see real fur being sold as faux [at stores including Burlington Coat Factory], because labeling laws didn’t require them to be labeled as fur. That led to the Truth in Fur Labeling Act. Then fast-forward another five years from there, and they’re going fur-free. Any fur that shows up in their supply chain will be immediately donated to homeless shelters. That’s something we’ve never been able to do, just because of their buying model. That’s my favorite part of their policy.” ",

      "text": "tweet \nAs the deep state continues to push the Russian election interference narrative—with no concrete evidence—the damage to US-Russia relations continues to grow. Sadly, those who continue to buy the Russiagate conspiracy theory have forgotten the US government’s history when it comes to propaganda used to start wars and bolster the military-industrial complex. \nA recent revelation from the newly released JFK Files can now help put this entire Russian hacking scenario into context—as it has been the subject of previous propaganda campaigns. On March 22, 1962, a meeting, held by the “Special Group (Augmented),” which according to an encyclopedia on the Central Intelligence Agency, included Attorney General Robert Kennedy, CIA Director John McCone, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lyman Lemnitzer, discussed the creation of a false flag attack on the United States to be blamed on the Soviets. \nAccording to the documents, the US government wanted to manufacture or obtain Soviet aircraft so they could launch an attack on America or friendly bases and use those attacks as a pretext for war. \nAccording to the previously Top Secret classified documents: Advertisment “There is a possibility that such aircraft could be used in a deception operation designed to confuse enemy planes in the air, to launch a surprise attack against enemy installations or in a provocation operation in which Soviet aircraft would appear to attack U.S. or friendly installations in order to provide an excuse for U.S. intervention.” \nAs the Daily Caller notes , the notion of using fake Soviet aircraft in a so-called “false flag” attack was first revealed in Robert Dallek’s “ An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963 ,” which was released in 2001. Dallek’s book says that the idea to manufacture or obtain Soviet aircraft was suggested by CIA Director McCone, however, the released documents say it was raised by Attorney General Kennedy. READ MORE: Declassified Secret Letter Exposes Warrantless Surveillance Program as Ineffective Sham \nAs people continue to believe the warmongering rhetoric from the state, they also continue to forget America’s history of lying to the people to get them to accept war. Indeed, the JFK files have now given us at least two incidents of the United States planning false flag attacks against its own people as a pretext to wage war. \nAs TFTP reported last month, the JFK files also reveal the plans for another false flag attack to be blamed on Cuba. In the document which was marked TS for Top Secret, the US military revealed its plans to trick Americans into war with Cuba. The plans were to create and carry out false flag terror attacks against American citizens and use them as propaganda to gain support for the war against Fidel Castro. \nIn the documents, officials noted that the plans for the attacks were “approved” and the Joint Chiefs merely needed to pick one of the nine “pretexts” to use to trick US citizens into war. \nThe plans involved killing innocent people and injuring others and making sure these instances would be “widely publicized” as propaganda to start an unjust war. \n“We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington. The terror campaign could be pointed at Cuban refugees seeking haven in the United States. We could sink a boatload of Cubans enroute to Florida (real or simulated),” the document reads. \nNotice how callous these monsters sound when talking about drowning a boatload of Cubans—which would have likely contained innocent children—to start a bogus war for profit. READ MORE: Cops Beat Man to Death in Front of Dozens of Witnesses \"For No Reason\" \nThe document continues, “We could foster attempts on the lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized. Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully chosen spots , the arrest of a Cuban agent and the release of prepared documents substantiating Cuban involvement also would be helpful in projecting the idea of an irresponsible government.” \nWhen reading the above documents, one should be naturally inclined to begin questioning every single war America has ever entered. It becomes perfectly clear that the US government cares not about deceiving its own citizens and killing innocent people so they can send our brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers off to other countries to die so the fat cats in DC can bolster their war portfolios on Wall Street.

      "text": "Home News 74 years ago,... 74 years ago, US Marines waded into ‘the toughest battle in Marine Corps history’— here are 25 photos of the brutal fight for Tarawa By - November 20, 2017 \nBy fall 1943, Japanese forces had been ejected from Alaska’s Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific, and the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific were on the verge of capture. \nUS forces now had to push into the Central Pacific, from which they could target Japanese strong points and communications lines. US officials had spent much of that year preparing for Operation Galvanic – the capture of the Gilbert Islands, a group of coral atolls that are now part of Kiribati. caption A map of positions on Betio, in the Tarawa atoll, a day after the US landing, November 21, 1943. source US Marine Corps/Wikimedia Commons \nHeld by the British until Japan seized them in December 1941, the Gilberts were “of great strategic significance because they are north and west of other islands in our possession and immediately south and east of important bases in the Carolines and Marshalls,” US Navy Fleet Adm. Ernest J. King wrote in official reports. \n“The capture of the Gilberts was, therefore, a necessary part of any serious thrust at the Japanese Empire.” \nThe attack on Tarawa focused on Betio , the principal island in the atoll, located at its southwest corner. \n“The island was the most heavily defended atoll that ever would be invaded by Allied forces in the Pacific,” historian and Marine amphibious officer Joseph Alexander wrote . \nUS Marines stormed ashore Betio on November 20, 1943. After 76 hours of intense fighting, they had wrested it away from tenacious Japanese defenders. \nBelow, you can see how US Marines waded into what one combat correspondent soon after called “the toughest battle in Marine Corps history.” US planes had done reconnaissance of Betio and Tarawa since the beginning of 1943. In August 1943, Vice Adm. Raymond Spruance, commander of the US Central Pacific Force, verbally assigned the capture of Tarawa Atoll to the Second Marine Division. In mid-September, Navy and Army planes bombed and photographed the atoll. \nTarawa is a coral atoll roughly triangular in shape. Its east side is about 18 miles long, while the south side is 12 miles long and the west side 12.5 miles long. The string of islands that make up the atoll ranged in altitude from 8 to 10 feet and were covered in coconut trees and dense shrubs. Betio is a bird-shaped island at the atoll’s southwest corner that at the time had an area of about 300 acres . Japanese commanders concentrated their forces on Betio, a strongly defended island at the southwest corner of the atoll, planning to destroy US transports at sea and then “concentrate all fires on the enemy’s landing point and destroy him at the water’s edge.” The island was estimated to have a garrison of 4,800 men — more than half of them first-rate troops. \nBetio’s defenders deployed steel tetrahedrons, minefields, and and dense thickets of barbed wire. Walls of logs and coral surrounded much of the island. Machine guns, rifle pits, and antitank ditches were often integrated into the barricades, and many emplacements, like pillboxes, were built to have converging fields of fire. \nAnti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines were scattered around the island, its lagoon, and its reef. Japanese forces on the island also had naval guns, coastal-defense guns, as well as field artillery and howitzers. \nSource: US Marine Corps Betio’s geography — narrow with no elevations higher than 10 feet — suited its defenders. “Every place on the island can be covered by direct rifle and machine gun fire,” Marine Col. Merritt Edison said. The island also lacked natural cover, and its tides and reef poised unique challenges. \nThe fight at Tarawa was the first large-scale encounter between US Marines and Japan’s Special Naval Landing Forces. Intelligence officers cautioned before the landing that “naval units of this type are usually more highly trained and have a greater tenacity and fighting spirit than the average Japanese Army unit.” Nevertheless, Marines were surprised at the intensity with which they fought. \nSource: US Marine Corps US commanders elected to attack what they believed was Betio’s weakest point — its northern side, which the Japanese had yet to mine. They knew the tide was not likely to be high enough for landing craft to float over Betio’s reef but planned to use amphibious tractors to take the first wave in and then return to carry more troops. \nSource: US Naval Institute , US Marine Corps D-Day for Tarawa was set for November 20, 1943. The timetable for operations in the Central Pacific left little time to gather landing craft and supplies in numbers the commanders wanted, nor for preparations, like diversionary landings on nearby islands. \nAdm. Chester W. Nimitz, commander in chief of the US Pacific fleet, considered the schedule for the campaign against the Marshall Islands, eight weeks after Tarawa, inviolable. US commanders also believed the Japanese could mount an air and submarine attack with three days of the start of operations against Tarawa. These factors limited the time US forces had for planning and preliminary bombardment against Tarawa. \nWhile en route a few days before the landing, Rear Adm. Harry Hill, commander of Task Force 53 that was to assault Tarawa, warned his force that it was “the first American assault of a strongly defended atoll” of the war in the Pacific. That was the first time the Marines learned the name of the island they were to attack. \nSource: US Marine Corps , US Naval Institute The task force’s transports arrived off the atoll after midnight on November 20. US troop transports started loading their landing craft a little after 3 a.m. The plan called for a half-hour of airstrikes at 5:45 a.m. and naval fire until the landing, which was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. But mix-ups and schedule changes plagued US forces in the hours beforehand. \nThe maneuver schemes “for the landing of the assault waves at Betio Island in Tarawa Atoll brought forth the most comprehensive landing attack orders promulgated up to that date in the Pacific amphibious campaigns,” according to the US Navy. \nSource: US Marine Corps The Japanese fired first, opening up with their coastal-defense guns at 5:07 a.m. US warships returned fire and then halted in expectation of strikes by US planes, but those aerial strikes had been postponed without warning. A second burst of Japanese fire, starting at 5:50 a.m., landed among the transports approaching Betio’s shore. \nSource: US Navy , US Marine Corps “In spite of this shelling, transports completed disembarking their assault waves, and got underway to northward at [6:16 a.m.] … only when enemy shells up to probably 8″ size began getting too dangerously close,” the commander of the transports reported. The Japanese salvos were inaccurate, and US warships quickly returned fire. \nSource: US Navy , US Naval Institute Disjointed shelling and bombardment continued for several hours. The landing time was delayed, first to 8:45 a.m. and then to 9 a.m. Just before 9 a.m., a Marine scout-sniper platoon and combat engineers darted onto the long pier that jutted into the lagoon, making quick work of its defenders. \nSource: US Marine Corps , US Naval Institute The scattered preliminary fire had failed to do significant damage to Japanese defenses, and lulls in the firing allowed the Japanese to regain their senses and shift their forces to the landing beaches. US transports and landing craft were hindered by strong tides and headwinds. \nSource: US Naval Institute , US Navy Marine assault waves were met with steadily increasing enemy fire. The amphibious tractors that took the Marines ashore had trouble with the seawall, leaving them stuck on the beach and vulnerable to pre-sighted Japanese fire Hand grenades thrown by the islands defenders also had lethal effect. Cpl. John Spillane, a St. Louis Cardinals prospect before the war, caught two grenades bare-handed and threw them back before a third exploded in his hand. \nSource: US Marine Corps The tractors fared well during the initial assault; only eight were lost to enemy fire. But they were gradually knocked out while in transit or ran out of fuel. The second and third waves of landing craft didn’t have as much armor as those in the first wave, and Japanese fire was especially damaging to them. \nSource: US Marine Corps Other landing craft couldn’t make it over the island’s reef, and many Marines had to wade ashore through withering Japanese fire. Some Navy coxswains ordered Marines off seaward of the reef, into deep water in which many drowned. Some companies sustained 70% casualties while approaching the beach. \n“Those who were not hit would always remember how the machine gun bullets hissed into the water, inches to the right, inches to the left,” Time correspondent Robert Sherrod wrote of landing. \nCommunications were also increasingly difficult, as water damage and enemy fire knocked out radios. There was either silence or chaos on command networks, and no one on the force’s flagship new what was happening on the beaches. Many troops, already embarked, would not make it ashore until sunset or the next day. \nSource: US Marine Corps , US Naval Institute Landing forces continued to struggle ashore Betio; however, once joint Navy-Marine shore-fire-control teams landed, fire support improved considerably. One team called down fire on a group of Japanese soldiers crowded around a bunker, killing the commander of the island’s garrison and his staff. The Marines’ own artillery was operational by daybreak on the second day. \nSource: US Naval Institute , US Marine Corps At the end of the first day, 5,000 men had crossed Betio’s reef, but 1,500 of them had fallen or were missing. US lines were thin and vulnerable; many Marines had struggled to get over the seawall on the beach. The fire coming over the coconut-tree logs was so heavy “a man could lift his hand and get it shot off.”",

N° - Le Crime de l'Orient-Express : 13,8 millions de dollars de recettes + © Twentieth Century Fox France 1 /6 \nJustice League au sommet ! Le film de super-héros, sorti mercredi dernier chez nous, détrône Thor 3 , solide leader pendant deux semaines, et descend sur la 3ème marche. Il affiche désormais un cumul de 247,3, soit plus que les deux précédents films de la saga sur l'ensemble de leur carrière (181 millions pour le premier Thor et 206,3 pour Thor : Le Monde des ténèbres ). \nSi Justice League approche les 100 millions de dollars dès son premier week-end d'exploitation aux Etats-Unis, il faut préciser que c'est une estimation inférieure à ce que l'on pouvait attendre d'un film DCU. Il s'agit en effet du plus faible démarrage pour le DC Universe. Le démarrage de Justice League est derrière Wonder Woman, Man of Steel, Suicide Squad ou encore Batman v Superman. Précisons par ailleurs que Justice League a réalisé un excellent démarrage en Chine ($51.7 million), dans la lignée de celui de Batman v Superman ($54 million) là-bas \nBox-office américain du 17 au 19 novembre 2017 : le Top 10 Rang (Rang précédent) ",

      "text": "The Future of Work, Gender, and Social Policy Nov. 20 2017 10:00 AM Thanksgiving Took Me and My Marriage to the Brink. Here’s How We Came Back From It. By Brigid Schulte Photo illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photos by Thinkstock. \nA few years ago, I spent most of Thanksgiving dividing up the furniture in the house for when the divorce came. My husband had just walked out the door with a six-pack of beer to hang out with a friend, leaving me with a kitchen explosion of vegetable peels and uncooked dishes, a scatter of recipes and cookbooks, a table yet to be set for 18, and one gigantic, raw bird. He could have that fucking blue-leather couch. \nTo say I was livid would be a gross understatement. Before we got married, we’d both promised each other we’d be partners and share our home responsibilities equally. As I furiously chopped Brussels sprouts, flung cranberries and miniature pumpkins on the table in a failed attempt at a Martha Stewart centerpiece, and jammed homemade stuffing into the turkey, my mind kept spinning: How had we gone so far off the rails? Advertisement \nBecause it wasn’t just like this at Thanksgiving. We both worked full time in demanding jobs. Yet at the time, my husband didn’t know who the kids’ dentist was, had never made summer camp plans, never bought toilet paper, or filled out all those damn school and Girl Scout forms. He’d never clipped baby fingernails, nor had he been the one to frantically figure out how to get work done when a snowstorm, strep throat, or unexpected barf threw the whole jerry-rigged system of work and child care into disarray. \nIt’s not like I was alone. Or that this exhausting, out-of-whack division of labor is uncommon. Time-diary analysis and a host of other studies show that women, on average, still do twice the housework and child care that men do, even when working full time or even when they bring home more bacon. (Wives earn more than husbands in 1 out of 3 U.S. marriages.) That unfair division of labor at home is a big part of what keeps the division of labor at work so unfair, why women are stuck in middle management, too tired to concentrate on big projects, or trapped in crappy, low-paying jobs, knocked off leadership tracks, or out of the workforce altogether. Unlike in other developed countries, women’s labor-force participation in the United States has been falling since 2000 —even though women’s wages account for the majority of family income increase since 1970. How can they find time to work these crappy jobs when they’ve got so much work to do at home? \nAnd it’s a big reason why many marriages don’t last. One study found that women initiate 69 percent of the divorces in heterosexual marriages, and another found that unfair divisions of household labor are a big reason why. (Same-sex couples fare better: Research has found that, without traditional gendered expectations, couples tend to talk more, adapt to changing circumstances, and negotiate fairer deals.) \nThe intense expectations that women should be responsible for creating the perfect holiday only whips all that low-level radioactive sludge of resentment that builds up over the years into a frenzy. If coming home to another workday of housework and child care is the second shift for women, as sociologist Arlie Hochschild called it, holidays like Thanksgiving are the third. Women are still largely expected to do the “ kin work ” of keeping family together, planning and organizing the holiday magic as well as being responsible for taking everyone’s emotional temperatures, and soothing ruffled feathers. Sometimes this means paying attention to the little things, like including people in conversations so no one feels left out and doing whatever’s needed to keep family gatherings on an even keel . Advertisement \nIt wasn’t until I experienced the holidays as a mother that I began swirling around the house in a sleepless flurry, barking at the kids, worrying about making the day special. My stress levels rising, I’d snap when my husband told me to just calm down. That’s when I realized I was acting just like my mother at the holidays. As teens we used to make fun of her, I’m ashamed to say, at how wound-up and bitchy she could get: She’s such a martyr. She’s ruining the day. Why can’t she just calm down? \nBut looking back, I realize now she was cooking, cleaning, polishing silver, washing wedding china, directing her bored and snarky daughters, and managing crises like broken dishwashers, while my dad watched football, asked for another scotch and water, and wasn’t expected to do more than cut the first few slices of turkey. (Mom did the rest.) I’m not sure she ever ate a hot meal on Thanksgiving or got more than a few hours of sleep. She certainly didn’t get any thanks. Schulte family. Peter Heimberg \nOn that miserable Thanksgiving a few years ago, when my husband returned sans beer, I said through gritted teeth that I wanted to enjoy the evening. But tomorrow, we needed to talk. \nWe went on a long walk, and I did the only thing I knew to do as a reporter when I don’t understand something: I brought a notebook and began asking questions, not only of my husband, but myself. Why had my husband never taken paternity leave? Why did I feel it was my responsibility to rush around the house frantically cleaning up so it would look nice before he got home from work, like my mom did, even though, unlike her, I’d had an exhausting day at work too? Why was I stabbed with guilt at the thought that I was a bad mother if I let him take the kids to the pediatrician? Why was I so consumed with performing what looked like the perfect Thanksgiving? Who was watching? The Housewife Police? Advertisement \nWhat we began to realize on that long walk is that we’d both gotten ourselves to this point where I was physically and mentally depleted and wanted to divide up the furniture for good—that, without even realizing it, we’d both fallen into the traditional gender roles we’d seen our parents inhabit, though I was also cramming full-time work into the mix. And if we wanted to stay together, and if we hoped for something different for our kids, we had to figure out how to change. \nSo we started small. We sat at the table and figured out how much work it takes to run the family, came up with common standards, and divided up the chores based on what we liked doing, not our gender. I like yardwork, so I do more of it. He likes cooking, so I gratefully eat whatever he puts on my plate every night. \nWe came up with rules, so we wouldn’t have to keep renegotiating or arguing: Last one out of bed makes the bed. In the morning, I empty the dishwasher, he loads. And if he doesn’t do it, I don’t rescue him and do it for him. Early on, I’d take out my iPhone, snap a photo, and text him, “Really?” He grocery shops. I do laundry. The kids do their own. We both fill out forms. We both make kids’ dentist, doctor, and other appointments and take turns taking them. The kids’ summer camp plans have turned into summer jobs, driving lessons, and college planning, and we share the load there, too. \nAnd I had to leave. I hadn’t traveled for work since the kids were born, both because I didn’t want to, and because I felt I couldn’t or shouldn’t. But I had reporting trips to do for what would become my book about time pressure and the still-powerful pull of traditional gender roles: Overwhelmed: How to Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time . It was only in physically removing myself that I realized my role as a loving wife and a good mother didn’t have to be defined by the chores I did but by the quality of the relationships I had and the time we shared. My husband, too, developed the confidence and competence not only to hold down the fort but to forge closer bonds with our son and daughter. \nIt isn’t perfect. I still somehow wind up being the one who buys toilet paper. But it’s better. And Thanksgivings are different in our house now. The first thing we think about as a family is not how the table would look if Martha Stewart dropped by with a scorecard but how we want the day to feel . Then we figure out the work that needs to be done to make that happen and divide the chores fairly. My daughter makes mashed potatoes. Our son handles the bread. I roast vegetables. Tom makes the turkey and stuffing (usually Stove Top, and I no longer care). All the neighborhood kids come over to bake pies and play charades. We eat. We laugh. We all do the dishes, and we all go to bed. It’s no longer just me—we are all responsible for creating the holiday magic. And that stupid blue couch? It’s been moved to the garage. \nBetter Life Lab is a partnership of Slate and New America . \n​Brigid Schulte is the director of the Better Life Lab at New America, author of Overwhelmed: Work, Love, & Play When No One Has the Time , and formerly an award-winning journalist at the Washington Post .

      "text": "Black Friday: why are South African retailers following an American tradition? That's the question many South Africans are asking about the massive shopping sale set for November 24.\nMedia monitoring firm ROi Africa managing director Tonya Khoury said many South Africans took to Twitter and Facebook last year to question why a tradition from the USA was followed in an African country.\n“Black Friday's presence on social media was huge‚ but also received a great deal of negative responses. There were racial undertones‚ with many misunderstanding the use of the word ‘black’ in ‘Black Friday’.\n“There were stampedes‚ and people hurt last year‚ and some retail outlets faced harsh criticism for this – and for the manner in which they advertised the event.”\nBut Black Friday is here to stay‚ she added.\nNo blackout on Black Friday‚ say retailers Will the \"glitch\" steal Christmas for online shoppers this Black Friday? News 15 hours ago “Retail sales events such as Black Friday can be exciting and provide consumers with opportunities to improve their living standards and save lots of money. Given the globalisation of retailing and the growing importance of online retail sales‚ it would appear that Black Friday is here to stay.” According to University of the Witwatersrand Business School marketing professor Steve Burgess‚ in the age of digital business‚ global retail has become a reality.\n“Even though the Thanksgiving Day holiday has no meaning in our country‚ South Africans have become aware of the availability of deep price cuts on Black Friday that are available online. In response‚ South African retailers are responding with their own specials.\n“This year‚ several South African retailers have made it clear that they intend to make their own deep-cut price promotions on Black Friday‚” he explained.\nBlack Friday tips for cyber-shoppers as discount season kicks off Black Friday is four days away, but the buying bonanza has morphed into Black Week for South Africans who shop online. News 20 hours ago Black Friday sales began in the United States as retailers took advantage of the day after the traditional Thanksgiving Day holiday – also the point in the year at which 11 months of retail sales should have fully covered a store's annual overheads‚ so that any more sales made‚ no matter at what price‚ put the operation further “in the black” in terms of their bank statements‚ hence the origin of the name.\n“Thanksgiving always occurs on the fourth Thursday in November. As most people take leave on the following day‚ and Thanksgiving precedes the Christmas holiday by four weeks‚ Black Friday provides retailers with a tremendous opportunity to ring up early Christmas holiday sales‚” Burgess said.",

      "text": "If Robert Mugabe and his family chose to move to South Africa‚ the government would have to provide them with a house and state security.\n“We have done this before‚ when we took in a former head of state‚ and he lived in Pretoria for several years‚” said Professor Anthoni van Nieuwkerk from the University of the Witwatersrand’s Centre for Defence and Security Management.\nHe was referring to South Africa giving refuge to ousted Haitian president‚ Jean-Bertrand Aristide‚ and his family in 2004. That cost the country approximately R5-million a year.\n“The monthly costs related to his accommodation‚ transport‚ office staff and security are similar to the cost associated to a South African cabinet minister‚” the Department of International Relations said at the time.\nAristide stayed in South Africa for about seven years‚ meaning approximately R35-million of taxpayers’ money was spent on him and his family.\n “If we have to do the same‚ although I think it is unlikely‚ [the Mugabes] will probably get a house and state protection for a period of time. They will have the rights and privileges of any citizen‚ but I am not convinced South Africa will agree to this‚” Van Nieuwkerk said.\nAsked to elaborate‚ Van Nieuwkerk said that Zimbabwe's first lady‚ Grace Mugabe‚ had a pending court case in this country.\n“She came here and beat up a South African citizen‚ and people have said that if she comes back here‚ she has to stand trial‚ so that is the first complication‚” Van Nieuwkerk said. “Our activists will most likely hound them until she stands trial.”\nThe second issue would be that international human rights activists would most likely come after Mugabe and force him to stand trial for crimes he committed in the 80s and 90s‚ Van Nieuwkerk added.\n“So it wouldn’t be a quiet and peaceful asylum. South Africa also needs to ask itself if it wants to be associated with retired dictators‚” he said.\n But the Mugabes are already familiar with the country‚ and reportedly own several properties in its affluent suburbs. Mugabe's sons‚ Robert Junior and Chatunga‚ have also spent the past few months in South Africa‚ where they live in an upmarket Sandton apartment.\nVan Nieuwkerk said‚ however‚ that the Mugabes also own properties in Hong Kong and Singapore‚ and could choose to live there.\nDr. John Akokpari‚ an associate professor in the department of political studies at the University of Cape Town‚ shared a different view.\nHe said that while opposition parties may be against South Africa granting the Mugabes asylum‚ it would be wise for them to agree.\n“Opposition parties have in the past suggested the simple toppling of Mugabe to decrease the high number of migrants in the country‚ but South Africa needs Zimbabwe more than Zimbabwe needs South Africa‚” said Akokpari.\n“Zimbabwe is South Africa’s biggest trading partner in the region‚ and South Africa is constantly looking for areas of investment‚ so it is unlikely that they would ever do anything to annoy Zimbabwe‚” he said.\n“That is why when Mbeki and Zuma have gone to mediate‚ they always appear sympathetic towards Mugabe. It is all about the countries’ shared history of colonialism and economic relations.”\nIf the Mugabe family decided not to come to South Africa‚ Akokpari said they could consider heading to Mozambique‚ Angola or Zambia‚ as these nations have historically received ANC and liberation fighters.\n“But the chances are higher that they will come to South Africa‚ and South Africa will most likely accept Mugabe‚” Akokpari added.\nVan Nieuwkerk‚ however‚ said it would be best if South Africa played an even hand‚ and rather gave the Mugabe's temporary accommodation.\n“South Africa can house them for a short term‚ as they plan to go to London or elsewhere‚” he said.",

      "text": "November 20, 2017 Quartz africa \nLast week, the Trump administration put the brakes on a proposed policy reversal on animal trophy hunting in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Several reports suggested the administration was reconsidering allowing the imports of elephant trophies from Zambia and Zimbabwe into the US. The ban was put in place in 2014 by the Obama administration. \nEven though the pause on the policy reversal might have something to do with a barrage of criticism from conservation groups, Trump said a decision will be made next week. But just how bad could things turn out for the elephant population in both countries if trophy hunting imports are allowed in the US? Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017 \nZimbabwe and Zambia are in the top five countries with the highest elephant populations in Africa. Per the 2016 Great Elephant Census (GEC), Zimbabwe accounts for the second highest elephant population while Zambia ranked fifth. Put together, both nations are home to over 100,000 elephants. That represents a sizable opportunity not just for legal hunters, but more critically, poachers. Across the continent, the reality is grim for the giant mammals: the total elephant population is pegged at just over 350,000. Between 2007 and 2014 alone, the elephant population is believed to have fallen by 30% . \nBig-game hunters have long advocated that controlled hunting can help fund conservations efforts in countries struggling to deal with maintaining their wildlife population amid poaching. But conservation groups argue otherwise citing the possibility of abuse of the permits. “Evidence shows that poaching has increased in areas where trophy hunting is permitted,” says Wayne Pacelle , chief executive at Humane Society, the United States’ largest animal protection group. \nZimbabwe isn’t new to controversy around poaching despite allowing trophy hunting. Back in 2015, the killing of a Cecil, a lion considered a national treasure and major tourist attraction in Hwange National Park, drew global ire . The lion had been lured out of the national park’s protected area and killed by an American dentist, Walter Palmer. \nElephants are also a prime target for poachers looking to for a slice of the $10 billion illegal wildlife trade (pdf). Ivory from elephant tusks in particular remain in high demand in Asia. While there’s been some progress—the proportion of illegally killed elephants has dropped for a fourth straight year —elephant killing in Africa still outpaces the population’s growth, a report by the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species showed. Global efforts to shut off the illegal ivory trade has gained some steam. China is set to enforce a ban by the end of the year. Hong Kong will follow suit in 2022. Allowing trophy imports into the US could open up a gap that may be exploited. (AP Photo/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi) \nA simpler argument conservationists have presented is that the numbers don’t add up. Trophy hunting has hardly been a boon for elephant populations on the continent. In Tanzania, the elephant population fell 60% between 2009 and 2014 while Mozambique saw a 50% drop in the same period. Both countries permit trophy hunting. Data also shows that revenue from tourism dwarfs payments by big-game hunters. \nEssentially, tourism, especially, national park safaris, are a much safer way to fund conservation efforts. Trophy hunting advocates cite the big checks hunters pay for their prizes but it turns out those prizes, like Cecil the Lion, are often the biggest tourist attractions at these parks. Revenue from tourism has been shown to be at least twenty times more than revenue from hunting permits in both Zimbabwe and Zambia. \nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.

      "text": "TV Magazine strike a pose EastEnders’ original Johnny Carter looks completely different after moving to US as actor Sam Strike debuts new look \nThe actor left EastEnders in 2014 and has gone on to have a career in the States By Fay Strang 20th November 2017, 3:43 pm Updated: 20th November 2017, 3:44 pm EASTENDERS actor Sam Strike looks virtually unrecognisable as he debuts a brand new look. \nThe 23-year-old, who played Johnny Carter in the BBC soap from 2013 until 2014, ditched his usual floppy hair in favour of a buzz-cut as he continues to carve out a career for himself in the US. Instagram Sam Strike looks completely different in his latest Instagram post \nShowing off his new hair, the actor posted a clip of himself on Instagram, before panning the camera round to show a cameraman. \nIt is a far cry from the fresh-faced actor viewers knew as the son of Queen Vic landlords Mick and Linda. \nIt is unclear what Sam is currently filming, however he recently played Monte Rissell, who had raped and murdered five women by the time he turned 19 , in Netflix drama Mindhunter. \nMonte is one of the dangerous convicts interviewed by FBI agents hoping to use their experience to crack current cases in the show, which is based on a true story. Sam with his on-screen EastEnders family, the Carters \nSam appears only in the fourth episode of series one, although a fan spotted his IMDB page had been updated to say that he also appears in the first episode of the as-yet-unfilmed second series. \nSam revealed he was leaving EastEnders in 2014, tweeting fans: \"Thanks for all the love this year guys. Means the world. Decided to bow out. couldn’t have done it without you all. thanks @bbceastenders.\" \nSome of his most memorable scenes was coming out to dad Mick - played by Danny Dyer - scenes that earnt him huge praise from fans and critics alike. BBC Sam in a promo shot for EastEnders when he played Johnny Carter in 2013 BBC One of Sam's biggest storylines was when Johnny came out to his dad \nAt the time he said: \"I was really nervous the night it aired because you want it to look convincing and to do justice by the people that have been there and done it. \n\"It was a real proving ground for me because it was the first time I actually had to do any proper drama acting. I’ve had letters and Danny’s had letters saying that we’d helped people to come out and it makes things worth it.\" \nSam has also scored a leading role in Leatherface, a prequel to Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and this year he started filming Monster Party Movie.

      "text": "US Launches Airstrikes in First Operation Targeting Afghan Opium share Print ISLAMABAD — \nThe United States has launched its first counter-narcotics military offensive in partnership with local allies in Afghanistan to try to deprive the resurgent Taliban of its largest source of funding. The move follows years of criticism that international forces are not doing enough to curb the opium trade. Speaking in Kabul Monday, General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. troops and NATO’s Resolute Support military mission, shared details of the coalition's first overnight counter-narcotics airstrikes. \nHe said the bombing campaign destroyed major Taliban narcotics production facilities in Helmand, the main poppy producing southern Afghan province, depriving the insurgent group of major revenues. \n“We hit the labs where they turn poppy into heroin. We hit their storage facilities where they keep their final product, where they stockpile their money and their command and control. Our estimates indicate that more than $200 million from this illegal economy was going into the pockets of the Taliban,” the general noted. \nCareful strikes He said the strikes are not hitting Afghan farmers and are being conducted carefully to limit the amount of collateral damage and avoid civilian casualties. \n“We will continue attacking these drug trafficking organizations who are supporting the Taliban and other terrorist organizations,” Nicholson said. \nAfghan Chief of Army Staff General Sharif Yaftali welcomed the move against the Taliban, which he called \"a criminal group\" benefiting from the narcotics business. \nThe United Nations announced last week that narcotics production nearly doubled this year in Afghanistan to around 9,000 metric tons, showing a nearly 90 percent increase compared with 2016. FILE - Afghan farmers collect raw opium as they work in a poppy field in Chaparhar district of Jalalabad, east of Kabul. \nCritics have long blamed the booming Afghan narcotics industry for being a major cause of prolonged hostilities and deteriorating security conditions in the country. \nThe U.S. military estimates income generated from the illicit drugs is providing 60 percent of funds for the Taliban insurgency. \nWar on Afghan drugs Nicholson said he has been given new authorities under the Trump administration's South Asia policy that allowed him to declare war on Afghan drugs and go after the enemy and all of their support, as well as revenue infrastructure across the country. \n“Narcotics revenue represents the largest single source of funding for the Taliban and as we know the Taliban are making more money than they need to fight their campaign. So, this money is going into the pockets of Taliban leaders who are living safely outside of the country,” he said. \nUnder the new policy President Donald Trump unveiled in August, about 3,000 additional American troops have arrived in Afghanistan. The U.S. military has increased airstrikes against the Taliban as well as terrorists linked to the Afghan branch of Islamic State. FILE - A U.S. armored vehicle patrols in Kabul, Afghanistan, Aug. 23, 2017. \nThe anti-narcotics operation and stepped up battlefield attacks are aimed at pressuring and compelling the Taliban to join an Afghan reconciliation process, said Nicholson. \nThe new policy, he said, also focuses on going after the havens or sanctuaries the Taliban and its allies enjoy outside of Afghanistan. U.S. and Afghan military commanders have long alleged neighboring Pakistan is sheltering the insurgents and not taking action against them despite public pledges. \n“We have had numerous high-level engagements between the United States and Pakistan so that we can get Pakistan to work with us in eliminating these safe havens of the enemy. This is extremely important going forward,” said Nicholson. \nFor their part, authorities in Pakistan deny the existence of any insurgent sanctuaries on its soil. They have called on Washington to share “actionable evidence” with Islamabad to enable Pakistani forces to go after any suspected militant hideouts on their side of the border. Your opinion",

      "text": "What was the DEA doing in Afghanistan? 01:01 (CNN) The US conducted airstrikes targeting opium processing labs in Afghanistan Sunday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Andrews tells CNN. The airstrikes were part of a joint US-Afghan operation targeting drug facilities in Taliban-controlled areas in northern Helmand Province. Three of the strikes occurred in Kajaki district, four in Musa Qala and one in Sangin. The airstrikes were carried out by US F-16s out of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and US B-52s flying out of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Andrews said. Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan, told reporters at the Pentagon that a US F-22 Raptor and Afghan Air Force A-29s also participated in the strikes. Afghan commandos rescue 15 people from Taliban prison Read More The strikes marked the first use of the F-22 in Afghanistan, according to US officials. The advanced stealth fighter aircraft is based at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and required refueling support from KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft to reach the target. US Air Forces Central Command, which oversees US aircraft in the region, said the US Marine Corps also operated long-range High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems in support of the operation. Nicholson said 10 facilities were hit during the course of the operation, with eight of them struck by US aircraft and two by Afghan warplanes.

Hide Caption 24 of 24 In one of the strikes a US B-52 used 2,000-pound bombs to destroy a facility and 50 barrels of opium, which Nicholson said held a street value of millions of US dollars. The general said that US forces had conducted hundreds of hours of surveillance and hundreds of analysts worked to identify the targets and minimize collateral damage, saying that the success against ISIS in Iraq and Syria had freed up assets to support the operation. Nicholson estimated that there are approximately 400 to 500 such facilities in Afghanistan in operation at any time, promising that such strikes would continue. \"These operations will continue on in the coming days,\" Nicholson said while adding, \"We are not going to let up.\" — USForces Afghanistan (@USFOR_A) November 20, 2017 A US defense official told CNN that US aircraft had since launched additional strikes against Taliban-linked opium facilities in addition to the 10 Nicholson announced. The operation which is officially known as Operation Jagged Knife, aims to target the source of Taliban revenue in much the same way the US military used airstrikes to destroy oil and other revenue sources for ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani announced the operation via Twitter on Monday saying Afghan forces supported by international troops \"launched operations in Helmand to abolish opium processing labs\" and that eight labs were destroyed. \"We're determined to tackle criminal economy and narcotics trafficking with full force,\" Ghani said, calling drugs \"the main source of financing (for) violence and terror.\" Last night, Afghan forces along with RS launched operations in Helmand to abolish opium processing labs. 8 labs were destroyed on day one. We're determined to tackle criminal economy & narcotics trafficking with full force. It's the main source of financing violence & terror. — Ashraf Ghani (@ashrafghani) November 20, 2017 Analysts believe the Taliban obtains much of its funding through the opium trade, increasingly processing the drugs in areas under its control. The new push against Taliban opium facilities comes in the wake of a new report by the United Nations Office on Drugs which recently estimated that opium production in Afghanistan had increased by 87% in 2017. Nicholson said that Afghanistan supplies an estimated 85% of the world's opium and about 4% of the heroin in the US according to estimates made by US law enforcement agencies. The ability for the US military to target Taliban facilities, regardless of whether they pose a direct risk to US or allied forces, was recently granted to commanders as part of changes to US strategy made by President Donald Trump. Under the previous administration the US could only target the Taliban under certain specific circumstances. \"The new authorities allow me to go after the revenue streams of the enemy,\" Nicholson said Monday. He said the new counternarcotics campaign \"hits the enemy where it hurts, which is their financial apparatus.\" But Nicholson said that while US troops would target refinement and trafficking facilities, they would refrain from targeting the poppy crop that is the source of the opium, saying that the Taliban is often forcing farmers to grow the illicit crop. \"We are not going after the farmers that are growing the poppy,\" he said.",

The trip comes as both countries face deteriorating relations with the US.

Ri Yong-ho's visit to Cuba demonstrates that North Korea is trying to build a new coalition – a coalition of anti-American states,\" Petrov explained. \nThe scholar emphasized that amid deteriorating relations with a number of countries around the world amid its ongoing nuclear and missile tests, the foreign minister's visits to Cuba is one of few real opportunities to revitalize relationship with former communist bloc allies. © REUTERS/ KCNA North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (not pictured) guides the launch of a Hwasong-12 missile in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on September 16, 2017 \nAsked about the topics Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho and his Cuban counterpart may discuss, Petrov said that there is certainly already a solid base of cooperation to build on. © Sputnik/ Andrei Olfert Bazooka-Toting, Tank-Riding Squirrels & Hedgehogs: The Wacky World of North Korean Children's Cartoons \"The relationship between Pyongyang and Havana [is] strong. Diplomatic relations were established in 1960. The [extent of] military and economic cooperation was seen just a few years ago when old North Korean-made MiG fighters were discovered in a North Korean freighter trying to pass through the Panama Canal, hidden inside a shipment of Cuban sugar. They were suspected of violating international sanctions, so the shipment was stopped, and the North Korean crew detained. So it became obvious that North Korea and Cuba continue to cooperate both economically and in some sort of military dimension as well. These are just small things of course, but who knows – maybe there is much more substantial cooperation between the former communist allies.\"\nAmid discussion in Western media that the visit could mean the start of some sort of mini-Cold War, Petrov stressed that a new Cold War has been underway for at least three years, and expands far beyond the North Korea-US rivalry. \"It started in approximately 2014,\" the analyst explained. \"Former communist bloc countries led by Russia now create a policy of antagonism against the US-led coalition, so we see this confrontation not only in Korea, but in China, the Middle East, Southeast Asia. The bloc mentality continues, and North Korea is simply a litmus test to this process. It's not only North Korea that is now under American and international sanctions, but also Russia.\" © Sputnik/ Grigoriy Sisoev From left: Russian President Vladimir Putin, South African republic President jacob Zuma, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Michel Temer seen at the BRICS leaders' meeting with BRICS Business Council members, September 4, 2017 \"This consolidation of blocs simply manifests this resurrection of this Cold War paranoia and mistrust,\" Petrov added. \"The US president has found himself under fire for his alleged collusion with the Russian government. This anti-Russian hysteria is continuing, and North Korea is simply trying to follow this trend, and revitalize its relations with former communist states – China, Russia, Cuba. Syria too demonstrates that the coalition mentality is very much on; I would call it Cold War 2.0.\" © AFP 2017/ MENAHEM KAHANA 'Last Thing China Wants is Conflict on Korean Peninsula' – Scholar As for the prospects of significant military cooperation between North Korea and Cuba, the analyst suggested that the term 'military cooperation' would really be something of a misnomer, given the two countries' limited military capabilities. \"The two countries are small…I would [call it] 'military reliance', or 'an attempt to stick together in an adverse environment'. Cuba has been treated adversely by the current US administration, and [found it] very difficult to trust [Washington]. We saw that Iran is very disappointed with Washington, and so is Cuba. North Korea is not willing to trust anything Washington may promise them.\"\nAccordingly, the relationship between North Korea and Cuba is highly symbolic, according to Petrov. \"The Cuban economy is very depressed, and not going to go very far without US endorsement. So these so-called 'pariah states' feel that they are not treated fairly, and must stick together and demonstrate solidarity in the face of this adverse treatment. It's likely that Russia and probably China are also going to join suit.\" © AP Photo/ Ramon Espinosa A soldier carries a life-size cut out of Cuba's late leader Fidel Castro during the May Day parade at Revolution Square in Havana, Cuba, Monday, May 1, 2017. © AFP 2017/ Juan Barreto EU-Cuba Agreement Signals New Era in Bilateral Relations In Spite Of US Blockade In any case, Petrov noted that Washington's reaction to all this is not difficult to predict. \"Relations between Washington and Havana have deteriorated just in the last year since the arrival of the Trump administration. US relations with North Korea are hanging on the brink of full-fledged war, potentially nuclear war. Relations can't be any worse, so Washington's reaction is going to be highly negative, vilifying both the North Korean and Cuban leadership for 'colluding and conspiring' against the US state.\"\nUltimately, the analyst said that strategically speaking, the problem for the US is that Cuba is too close. North Korea is far away, and that's why talk of nuclear war with North Korea doesn't bother anyone in Washington, he observed. The Cuban case is different. \"We remember the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which was very sobering for the US government and the Soviet leadership, so it was resolved very quickly. It was just too close to the United States and far away from the Soviet Union. With North Korea, it's exactly the opposite: it's very close to China and Russia and far away from the US.\" CC0 / CIA A U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenance \"So what Pyongyang is trying to achieve is just to have some kind of balance of threat between Cuba and North Korea. So if something goes wrong with North Korea in the military or diplomatic theater, Cuba might reactivate its diplomatic and potentially military activity as well,\" Petrov concluded. ...",

      "text": "Nebraska regulators approve Keystone XL pipeline Published time: 20 Nov, 2017 16:13 Edited time: 21 Nov, 2017 07:15 Get short URL © Global Look Press Nebraska regulators approved the Keystone XL pipeline route through the state, despite a oil leak last week that dumped 210,000 gallons of oil on arable farmland in South Dakota. \nWith three votes in favor and two against, the Nebraska Public Service Commission (NPSC) approved the pipeline route on Monday. The body was tasked with assessing whether the route was in the state’s best interests, but could not consider the risk of spills since the project already had an environmental permit. \nThe NPSC has been reviewing the proposed 275-mile route of TransCanada Corp’s crude oil pipeline since February. \nCommissioner Crystal Rhoades, the body’s sole Democrat, voted against the pipeline in part because it was not following the originally proposed route. \n“The route being approved here today is a different route, and not the focus of the intense study,” said Rhoades. She said the new route violated due process rights of at least 40 landowners, who would be affected by the change and “may not know that the pipeline is along this path, and may not have had an opportunity to make a case before this commission.” Read more At least 210,000-gallon oil spill causes Keystone Pipeline closure in S. Dakota \nThe pipeline would run through fragile soil that has a high probability of landslides and crosses the main Ogallala Aquifer, Rhoades said. \nOpposition to the line has been driven mainly by a group of around 90 landowners whose farms lie along the proposed route. They are worried spills could pollute water critical for grazing cattle, and that tax revenue will be short-lived and jobs will be temporary. \nJust two day ago TransCanada’s existing Keystone system spilled 5,000 barrels in South Dakota and pipeline opponents said the spill highlighted the risks proposed by the proposed expansion. \n“The spill only confirms all our fears,\" Jeanne Crummly, a rancher in Page, Nebraska told Reuters. \nThe proposed pipeline is an extension of the existing Keystone pipeline, which went into service in July 2010, and runs south through North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas, with spurs east into Missouri and Illinois. It would carry an estimated 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from northern Alberta, Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast. \nIt could be months before construction begins because of promised lawsuits and uncertainty over the economic viability of the $8 billion project. TransCanada and its supporters have said the project would bring economic benefits and could be operated safely. The company said last week’s spill near Amherst, South Dakota, was contained and being cleaned up. \nA 2014 state Department study predicted just 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs. The project was rejected by President Obama in 2015, citing concerns about carbon pollution. President Donald Trump revived it in March, saying the pipeline would create 28,000 jobs and boost the US energy industry.",

      "text": "US Navy Deploys Unmanned Submersibles in Argentine Submarine Search Story Number: NNS171119-02 Release Date: 11/19/2017 8:40:00 PM From U.S. Naval Forces Southern   NAVAL STATION MAYPORT, Fla. (NNS) -- The U.S. Navy has deployed unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) to join in the search for the Argentine navy's submarine, A.R.A. San Juan, in South Atlantic waters. The equipment consists of one Bluefin 12D (Deep) UUV and three Iver 580 UUVs, which are operated by the U.S. Navy's recently-established Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron 1, based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The UUVs are uniquely capable to help in the search. Both types are capable of deploying quickly and searching wide areas of the ocean using Side Scan Sonar, a system that is used to efficiently create an image of large areas of the sea floor. The Bluefin 12D is capable of conducting search operations at 3 knots (3.5 mph) at a maximum depth of almost 5,000 feet for 30 hours, while the Iver 580s can operate at a depth of 325 feet, traveling at 2.5 knots (2.8 mph) for up to 14 hours. The U.S. government is providing rapid response capabilities, including aircraft, equipment and personnel to assist the government of Argentina in its search for the missing submarine. In addition to the UUVs, the U.S. has deployed aircraft to assist in the search, as well as underwater equipment specifically designed for submarine search and rescue. One Navy P-8A aircraft is already in Argentina, where it joined a NASA P-3 research aircraft currently supporting the ongoing search efforts over the submarine's last known location. U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) directed the deployment of this equipment and personnel to Argentina to support the country's request for international assistance aimed at locating the missing submarine and crew. SOUTHCOM is one of the nation's six geographically-focused unified commands with responsibility for U.S. military operations in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.",

(NNS) -- A second U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon multi-mission maritime aircraft will deploy to Bahia Blanca, Argentina, Nov. 19 to join an ongoing international search for the Argentinean Navy's submarine A.R.A. San Juan in Southern Atlantic waters. The aircraft and a crew of 21 personnel will depart Jacksonville, Fla., and are expected to arrive in Argentina the same day. One Navy P-8A aircraft is already in Argentina, where it joined a NASA P-3 research aircraft already supporting the ongoing search efforts over the submarine's last known location. Additionally, the U.S. Navy's Undersea Rescue Command (URC), based in San Diego, Calif., is deploying two independent rescue systems that can be used to support underwater search and rescue missions, depending on various oceanic factors, including depth, floor conditions, currents and other safety considerations. U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) directed the deployment of the P-8A aircraft, underwater rescue equipment and associated personnel to Argentina to support the country's request for international assistance aimed at locating the missing submarine and crew. The P-8A Poseidon is the Navy's newest maritime, patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and is configured with state-of-the-art sensors and communications equipment, allowing it to support a wide range of missions over large bodies of water, including sub-surface search-and-rescue operations. It can reach an airspeed of 564 mph, has a ceiling of 41,000 feet and a range of 1,200 nautical miles with four hours on station, allowing it to loiter over search areas. In April, SOUTHCOM deployed a P-8A Poseidon to Galeo Air Force Base in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where it took part in an internationally-supported search for The Republic of Korea ship, Stella Daisy, which tragically sank in the Southern Atlantic, off the western coast of Africa. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in October, P-8A Poseidon aircraft conducted overflight assessment missions, capturing images of conditions on the ground in Dominica to support U.S. foreign disaster assistance operations led by the U.S. Agency for International Development. SOUTHCOM is one of the nation's six geographically-focused unified commands with responsibility for U.S. military operations in the Caribbean, Central America and South America.",

      "text": "(CNN) The US conducted airstrikes targeting opium processing labs in Afghanistan Sunday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Andrews tells CNN.\nThe airstrikes were part of a joint US-Afghan operation targeting drug facilities in Taliban-controlled areas in northern Helmand Province. Three of the strikes occurred in Kajaki district, four in Musa Qala and one in Sangin. The airstrikes were carried out by US F-16s out of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and US B-52s flying out of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Andrews said. Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan, told reporters at the Pentagon that a US F-22 Raptor and Afghan Air Force A-29s also participated in the strikes. Afghan commandos rescue 15 people from Taliban prison Read More The strikes marked the first use of the F-22 in Afghanistan, according to US officials. The advanced stealth fighter aircraft is based at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and required refueling support from KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft to reach the target. US Air Forces Central Command, which oversees US aircraft in the region, said the US Marine Corps also operated long-range High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems in support of the operation. Nicholson said 10 facilities were hit during the course of the operation, with eight of them struck by US aircraft and two by Afghan warplanes.

Hide Caption 24 of 24 In one of the strikes a US B-52 used 2,000-pound bombs to destroy a facility and 50 barrels of opium, which Nicholson said held a street value of millions of US dollars. The general said that US forces had conducted hundreds of hours of surveillance and hundreds of analysts worked to identify the targets and minimize collateral damage, saying that the success against ISIS in Iraq and Syria had freed up assets to support the operation. Nicholson estimated that there are approximately 400 to 500 such facilities in Afghanistan in operation at any time, promising that such strikes would continue. \"These operations will continue on in the coming days,\" Nicholson said while adding, \"We are not going to let up.\" \"Last night, we conducted strikes into Northern Helmand to hit the Taliban where it hurts: their narcotics financing.\" -Gen. Nicholson, USFOR-A #AFGStrong https://t.co/RLjDdSYTlI @CENTCOM @USAFCENT @DeptofDefense @TOLOnews @pajhwok @HM_Kakar @1TVNewsAF @ArianaNews_ @KhalilNoori pic.twitter.com/152rTR236z \n— USForces Afghanistan (@USFOR_A) November 20, 2017 A US defense official told CNN that US aircraft had since launched additional strikes against Taliban-linked opium facilities in addition to the 10 Nicholson announced. The operation which is officially known as Operation Jagged Knife, aims to target the source of Taliban revenue in much the same way the US military used airstrikes to destroy oil and other revenue sources for ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani announced the operation via Twitter on Monday saying Afghan forces supported by international troops \"launched operations in Helmand to abolish opium processing labs\" and that eight labs were destroyed. \"We're determined to tackle criminal economy and narcotics trafficking with full force,\" Ghani said, calling drugs \"the main source of financing (for) violence and terror.\" Last night, Afghan forces along with RS launched operations in Helmand to abolish opium processing labs. 8 labs were destroyed on day one. We're determined to tackle criminal economy & narcotics trafficking with full force. It's the main source of financing violence & terror.\n— Ashraf Ghani (@ashrafghani) November 20, 2017 Analysts believe the Taliban obtains much of its funding through the opium trade, increasingly processing the drugs in areas under its control. The new push against Taliban opium facilities comes in the wake of a new report by the United Nations Office on Drugs which recently estimated that opium production in Afghanistan had increased by 87 percent in 2017. Nicholson said that Afghanistan supplies an estimated 85% of the world's opium and about 4% of the heroin in the US according to estimates made by US law enforcement agencies. The ability for the US military to target Taliban facilities, regardless of whether they pose a direct risk to US or allied forces, was recently granted to commanders as part of changes to US strategy made by President Donald Trump. Under the previous administration the US could only target the Taliban under certain specific circumstances. \"The new authorities allow me to go after the revenue streams of the enemy,\" Nicholson said Monday. He said the new counternarcotics campaign \"hits the enemy where it hurts, which is their financial apparatus.\" But Nicholson said that while US troops would target refinement and trafficking facilities, they would refrain from targeting the poppy crop that is the source of the opium, saying that the Taliban is often forcing farmers to grow the illicit crop. \"We are not going after the farmers that are growing the poppy,\" he said.",
